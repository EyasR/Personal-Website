                                    <i>the following rules are proposed but not currently in play</i> <br/><br/>
                                    <h3 id="Ressurection">Resurrection</h3>
                                        (Adapted from source: Matt Mercer)
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Character death can often prove to become a minor inconvenience in some campaigns once the adventuring party reaches a certain level, with spells being available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife with temporary setbacks, robbing a small element of danger, and threat to future conflicts and challenges within the story. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 2 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul’s connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Upon a successful resurrection check, the player’s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Only the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the True Resurrection or Wish spells. These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the Revivify spell or similar effects), no contribution skill checks are allowed. The character casting the spell makes a Rapid Resurrection check, rolling a d20 and adding their spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is 10, increasing by 2 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone. On a failure, the character’s soul is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases any future Resurrection checks’ DC by 2. No further attempts can be made to restore this character to life until a resurrection spell with a casting time higher than 1 action is attempted.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                                        Farnjar has been resurrected twice already. His base DC is then 10 + 2*2 = DC 14.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Cleric Tandi attempts to cast revivify immediately after a combat.  Being a spell with 1 action to cast, she rolls a d20 + spellcasting modifier +3. Roll: 9+3 = 12.  The resurrection fails, and the DC for future saves goes up by 2.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        After doing a long-rest, Tandi attempts again, this time with raise dead, which has a 1 hour casting time.  Her party members help:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Bruno, the paladin, praying to the god of the devout, is ruled by the DM to require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty.  The DM sets this at DC 12.  Role: 12+5 = 17.  As a result DC for the RES test is reduced by 3.</li>
                                            <li>Ajax, the barbarian, loudly demands the soul of the fallen to return from the aether.  The DM required a Charisma (Intimidation) check at difficulty since it was unlikely that gods of the departing soul would listen to such a plea. The DM sets this at DC 22. Role: 13 +6 = 19.  As a result the DC for the RES test is increased by 1.</li>
                                            <li>Willowleaf, a druid, creates a concoction of herbs that his forest god taught him.  He drains this into the open mouth of Farnjar and offers some to the rest of the helpers.  This is ruled by the DM to require a Medicine or Nature check at medium difficulty. The DM sets this at DC 15.  Role: 16 + 6 = 22.  As a result the RES test is reduced by 3.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        The DM now rolls a final check as follows: Base DC 16 - 3 (Bruno) + 1 (Ajax) - 3 (Willowleaf) = DC 11.  Role: 15 = pass.  Farnjar is brought back to life and his new base resurrection save is DC 18.

                                    <h3 id="LingeringWounds">Lingering Wounds</h3>
                                        Lingering wounds can be applied after all are TRUE:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Critical hit</li>
                                            <li>near-max damage</li>
                                            <li>with the use of an inspiration point</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        The DM will apply lingering wounds on PCs when monsters CRIT and do near-max damage.
