                                    <h3>A missing caravan, and, a wandering halfling friend found</h3>
									<p>
                                        By a coincidence or perhaps some run-of-the-mill dabbling of fate by an ambitious sub-deity acting upon a hapless group of humanoids, the party, one (half?) short, came  to answer a job for adventurers in the town of Saltmarsh in the Kingdom of Keoland.  A human wizard, Mejdrich, fancying himself a diviner, waited impatiently for the  task he felt obligated to do.  A mysterious half-elf Rogue, Belizar, arrived late and played the outsider who could take it or leave it.  Finally, a goliath fighter,Urgor, stood ever eager at the front, sizing up the Captain of the Guard... and everyone else.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        The mission was to investigate a lost caravan travelling from the capital to Saltmarsh, which would be rewarded with gold.  Charles, a semi-retired veteran of the guard was to accompany the party on the outing.  He was clearly favored. Captain gave him a flail.  No mind he had a peg leg.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        In travel the group managed to spook passing caravans with a little "goliath under the sack in the back of the cart" trick Urgor mastered.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        When the lost caravan was found, the party was ambushed by bandits, led by a jackalwere.  The battle was joined by a wee guy, Seja, a wandering halfing cleric who recently left his hermitage with wild story of doom about to befall on Saltmarsh.  An investigation of the scene suggested that the merchants were taken into Dreadwood, but hey-ho the goods were all saved.  The party declined entering into Dreadwood, leaving the merchants to their fate.  Mejdrich made a new friend, charming one of the bandits, who learned about Nightshade, a mysterious figure in the Dreadwood who always got her due.  Being the good 'friend' he was, Mejdrich let Bandit off the hook with a couple of gold and even agreed to get a drink sometime he was in Saltmarsh together... nothing bad could come from this...</p>

                                    <h3>A night out in Saltmarsh, and, a quest for a drowned slave</h3>
									<p>
                                        After returning to their individual lodgings (and circumstances therein), the party convened at the Wicker Goat for a celebration.  Dwarves were packing the place, all in a pretty good mood over what you came to learn was a new find at the mine.  Music and merriment was not in short supply.  Seja danced on the table, Belizar played the bone pipes and Charles played some spoons with the band.  Following this some tavern games commenced.  The party did quite well - Urgor arm wrestled with a dwarven foreman, Seja nearly passed out under the stiff Dragonfire Stout, and Belizar's unconventional use of the bone pipes to coax an ox forward left you feeling good in the night.  Belizar then had a tense meeting with a mysterious figure in an alley on the way back to his room. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        In the morning the group gathered at Ander's Solmor's mansion to settle the issue of the 100gp.  Anders and his butler Skerrin were pleased to accept the full 100gp (they offered half as a finders fee) to recompense the merchant's families.  He was distressed to hear that the bandits did not kill the merchants and feared slavers were involved.  The party was then informed that a woman in manacles  washed up drowned in Saltmarsh in the morning.  Ander's knew that she was an adventurer in town who had previously sought work at his company, but was known to have been exploring the haunted house.  The party learned a bit more about this - apparently it was a place that had a great treasure and used to have a hermit alchemist who lived their many years ago.  The location was widely avoided by people in Saltmarsh.  However, with the current news, the Council, at Ander's urging hired the party to investigate and eliminate any threats.

                                    <h3>Uncovering the legend of the haunted house, and, a snake in the grass?</h3>
									<p>
                                        The party headed out of Saltmarsh on a job for the town council to investigate and clear a haunted mansion outside of town. There have been all manner of stories around the house: ghost filled, used to be owned by a crazy hermit alchemist, great hordes of treasure -- but also a very dangerous place.  Yet the recent events, young woman adventurer washing up dead on the shores of the town in shackles, prompted the council to action to see if slavers are involved.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        At the edge of town you ran into Charles who offered to help with the haunted mansion and the party agreed to split the shares with him.  He mentioned that an old poacher who lived outside town was rumored to know something about it.  Stopping at the poachers shack, Urgor hopped the fence and threatened poor old Ralf, who turned tail and ran without hesitation.  The group left him go and continued to the haunted house.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        With the weather deteriorating the party arrived at the house, which, as alluded to in the stories looked truly haunted -- dilapidated, rotted out, filled with cobwebs, the house looked nearly ready to fall off the cliff it sat next to.  Cautiously the party inspected the entry and, deciding it better to enter through the garden (rather than the main trail next to the cliff face), was ambushed by a family of giant weasels.  It was a slamming success -- if one were to describe the brilliance of Charles' flail work.  After some discussion on how to enter, the group decided to simply enter through the main door.  Tracks that were found led the party to two entrances to the basement, one through a trapdoor, one through set of stairs at the back of the house.  The rooms were all searched and there were several curios found along with several swarms of spiders.  Several items were found led the party to believe there may indeed have been an alchemist living there at one time.  The party, ready to descend downstairs heard a faint moan somewhere else in the house and, after investigating, found Ned bound and gagged on the second floor.  His story was that he was an adventurer from Seaton who, on entering the house was ambushed by an unknown number of assailants and left to die.  The party let him tag along, on his request, and even helped him recover his gear that was left in a nearby room.  Other points of interest: [1] on the second floor a particular window had markings of heavy equipment, the party discussed the possibility of this being used as a location for signaling. [2] In two locations an eerie, a tortured and terrifying cry was let out.

                                    <h3>A running retreat in the haunted house, and, the greatest wizard ever?</h3>
									<p>
                                        Down into the caverns below the haunted house we go... well not until after Ned sneaked off leaving Belizar fighting off a pack of rot rubs streaming out of a dead adventurer in the wine cellar.  Ned slunk off before you could find him and Charles barreled down the stairs to support Belizar.  The remainder of the party followed shortly after.  The grubs were a bother indeed, but it was a near death experience when Ned returned and stabbed Mejdrich in the back before running back through the house.  The party regrouped in the wine cellar and found a secret door into a makeshift barracks.  Upon entering they were ambushed with a cloud of smoke and crossbow bolts.  At that moment Ned came tumbling down the stairs which had been trapped with some sort of grease and fell prone.  The party dispatched two of the three bandits who slipped away 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        with a witch bolt, who, after repeated rounds of lightning coursing through his body slumped dead. "He had it coming..." remarked Mejdrich.  After finding a well kept room with various goodies, the party decided not to disturb the door sealed shut with the words DANGER marked on it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Finally in the descent into the caverns a host of bandits were camped and ready for the party.  There was smoke, grease, tight quarters (not too tight for the halfling), slime, hobgoblins, and there was Sanbalet.  Shouting order, and boasting of his greatness, the Mejdrich was downed by magic missiles.  The insults flew "most puny giant I have ever seen", "step on that roach of a halfling", "I spit on your rapier", and unspeakable personal attacks on Charles' peg leg.  In last minute maneuver Belizar attempted to pull the party back for a retreat and to pull the door with the DANGER on the enemies.  Urgor withstood countless attacks in the retreat. Yet the fighting was fierce and they only made it up to the barracks before Charles was downed (and nearly died), saved only by Seja's medicine skills.  The remaining enemies, and even the great Sanbalet were killed off and the party, thick with emotions, discussed the fight.

                                    <h3>Contraband in the caverns, and, a disappearing alchemist?</h3>
									<p>
                                        We found the party in the barracks discussing tactics during a short rest. They, well, agreed to disagree that the foray into the sea caverns battle, and subsequent retreat was good or bad.  Charles said a few last words before dropping into a coma. Belizar then scouted the remaining caverns finding what appears to be contraband (bolts of silk, casks of brandy, and morningstars with the seal of king Skotti).  He also found Gerard Browning, who was tied up had been beaten.  Reporting back to the group, they questioned his story -- which sounded vaguely familiar to Ned's.  The party resolved to tying him up and Urgor and Mejdrich grilled him.  He didn't seem to know much, claiming he was hired by a man, who he didn't see (but had a strange mannerism, ending his statements by clearing his throat), in a dark alley to scout the haunted house to see if/what the smugglers were doing here.  The party then went on to open up the DANGER door finding a half dozen skeletons and a skeletal alchemist who attempted to lob vials of acid at Belizar (but missed).  Clearing the skeletons, they found a secret laboratory of the alchemist who had a number of golden items and other oddities.  A full search of all remaining rooms in the house commenced.  Mejdrich identified a bag of holding and a cursed luckstone (which now seems to not be removable from his neck), and detected magic on a number of other items (see list below).  The party setup in the barracks and barricaded the entrances.  No issues through the night.  Charles was healed by Seja in the morning, and seeing the weather still poor/stormy, the party decided to return to Saltmarsh with as much as they could carry. They brought 1 cask of brandy, 1 bolt of silk, and 1 morningstar to show the council.  Seja walked off with another cask in hand and another was placed in the bag.  The party is set to return with  the pony loaded up and is on foot (Charles mounted), Gerard's hands tied up.  Time is now 10:00AM in the morning, stormy weather continues.

                                    <h3>A test for Urgor, and, a cat, a monk and flying dookie?</h3>
									<p>
                                        After having gathered the loot (leaving the contraband in behind in the alchemist's workshop), the party found their dear pony dead under the eaves of the haunted house.  A quick fight with stirges left Belizar unconscious behind the garden wall.  Healed, the party left, with Charles being carried by Urgor, trudging through the muddy main road.  Not long after, they sighted a rider who turned out the be Kiara Shadowbreaker, Castellan / Captain of the Burle outpost, accompanied by a second night and two wood elves.  She explained that they were tracking dire wolves who were sighted leaving from Dreadwood and asked the party for a volunteer to assist this hunt -- Belizar.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Belizar and the hunting company swiftly carried out their hunt.  They found two dire wolves attacked and killed the old poacher along the road.  Shortly thereafter they found and ambushed the dire wolves, dispatching them.  Kaira shared a few details of the situation at Dreadwood: 1) Recent incursions have picked up in pace, 2) Nightshade is some evil entity that has undead, humans, evil fey under their control and hinted that the party would be in over their heads (but would welcome information as would the wood elves), 3) In the past both she and Eliander had a hand in putting down a major threat in Dreadwood.  Belizar was welcomed at Burle if he should visit in the future.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Meanwhile the party trudged along and found the remains of the poacher.  Seja offered a short prayer to Yondalla, who approved of his sympathy towards the poor soul.  Just before coming back into town Ingo the Drover met the party as he was on his way out to help the party and learn of its fate.  He was relieved to see everyone alive.  He related that Saltmarsh was in a sour mood due to the poor weather and that Gellan Primewater was planning a celebratory event should the party return (or if they should not).  He also told Urgor that an illegal bare-knuckles boxing match was being held that evening and Captain Xendros was expected to be in attendance.  The party decided to go and support Urgor.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        The match was held at an abandoned warehouse located at Crabber's Cove, at the far East end of town.  The area was eerily quiet and overrun by thousands of crabs.  Entering, the party stumped the participation fee of 210gp for Urgor to compete and Ingo gave him his personal 'fighting wraps'.  Three fight ensued, the first being with a Dragonborn from Xendos' company: Goraxan, who fought dirty but was roundly pummeled by Urgor, who managed to gain the favor of Xendros (Mejdrich prestidigitation-ed him and made him crap himself, which he tried to kick onto Urgor, who dodged. The dookie in question landed on Xendros...).  The second match was with Nine Lives More, a Tabaxi sailor, who had a stick and move technique, and stayed mostly to the second story.  Urgor brought her down by throwing a bench he ripped off the structure.  The final match was with Yelena Hu, a monk, who nearly dropped Belizar before the match. But first, they drank... and drank... and drank.  Although Urgor kept up with Yelena, she drank just one more swig than him, to his chagrin.  Somehow the drunken monk managed to land blow after blow on Urgor, dropping him to 5hp before he could catch and squeeze her to submission.  The winner, Urgor gained bracers of defense, 500gp, and a date with Xendros

									<p>
                                        Following the council meeting the group disperses to their own business, with the group agreeing to help the council neutralize the remaining smugglers if/when they return to the haunted house by boat.  They expected roughly 1 to 2 weeks of time before it was likely to sight the ship, judging by the contraband found at the Haunted House.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Mejdrich approaches both Seja and Urgor regarding their quests and offers help; Seja with interpreting his vision and Urgor with studying his artifact if Urgor ever finds it and any relevant information in Keledek's tower.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Seja makes a trip to the armor to adjust the mariner's mail and purchase a shield.  He stops in Gerard at the Empty Net who asks to be set free following (i.e. not having to answer to the council and meet who-ever was in the alley), Seja refuses. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Belizar meanwhile is asked by Gellan Primewater to retrieve a former crew on a boat that was thought lost in the recent storm, nearby the Carrion Archipelago.  Prior to leaving he meets up with Gerard and agrees after all to free him, even giving him a few coins to get provisions to get back to Seaton.  Gerard offers Belizar safe lodgings in Seaton if needed.  Belizar sneakily follows Gerard after he lets him go but does not see anything unusual.  Belizar sets off first thing in the morning on the Ruby Pearl a two masted trade-ship captained by Vario.
                                        <br/><br/>  
                                        Charles suggests to Urgor that joining the town guard, through Eliander, might be a good way to earn a coin.  Urgor doesn't want to be tied down in one location and refuses help in getting a job.  Nonetheless, he visits Eliander, in hopes of gaining access to his library, which apparently holds a large collection of books of local history, and clues to where Arkon Demoncarver may have been.  Eliander says he doesn't allow access to strangers and refuses.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Seja returns to the Temple of Procan to find the head cleric, Wellgar Brinehanded, and asks him if he's had a chance to think about Seja's vision.  Wellgar recognizes the two giant runestones and says that the standing stones at the edge of town might be it.  He offers to take Seja there, but has been underwater with two issues: dozens of workers coming to the temple from the fishmonger's district blinded and reports of an imp-like creature stealing salted fish from the warehouses, suspected to come from the Warthakeel ruins. Seja agrees to investigate and stakes out the district over the evening with a young town guard recruit, Frederick.  Although the perpetrators are not found, a substance later discovered to be a powerful version of "malice", a burned poison, which causes blindness was found to be put into the lanterns at the warehouses.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Belizar does his best to fit in with the crew on the Ruby Pearl, which he finds to be impeccably run.  He challenges some of the crew to a race around the boat, narrowly losing to the top rigger of the crew.  He learns about some of the threats on the sea and how to identify them.  Smooth sailing as the weather improves.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Urgor goes to the Saltmarsh cemetery to try and find Krag, a half-orc who tends it and is a scholar of local history.  He surveys the grounds and as the sun goes down is approached by Krag, who is well-mannered and academic.  They enjoy a cup of tea under candlelight at the shack at the end of the grounds while Krag carefully writes down Urgor's story.  Unfortunately Krag does not know of Arkon, but suggests Eliander's library or talking to Captain Xendros who leads the trade delegation for Iuz.  He says that earning Eliander's trust is key to gaining access, but offers to contact Urgor if anything is found in his own studies.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        With the thefts and cases of blindness continuing, Seja makes for Warthalkeel ruins, stopping to stay over in Seaton.  He sees Ingo the Drover at the haunted house along the way, observing the coast.  Once in Seaton, he finds it to be heavily fortified and avoids entering the inner part that is protected by walls, instead staying quietly at a temple of Pelor.  The priestess there tells him of the story of Warthakeel which was, many years ago, dedicated to worshiping a Kraken, but at some point was destroyed by that Kraken and was knocked into the sea.  The next morning, on the way out, he sights Gerard in Seaton and confronts him.  Gerard explains what happens, and to return the favor, agrees to assist Seja given he has some knowledge of the area.  The two head out to after Gerard gears up.

                                        The Ruby Pearl approaches the islands and begins searching for signs of the Crescent, Gellan's lost ship.  Belizar learns more about how the ships operate in the Primewater company. After a half day of searching, the wreckage is found.  The ship is destroyed and only a segment of its starboard hull and aft castle remain, stranded on the rock.  Luckily the crew member, Kell -- a sea mage, is found on a nearby island. He explains that the ship, battered in the storm, was then attacked by a blue dragon in the area and is the only known survivor. Belizar leads the rescue.  Kell also requests that Captain Vario take him to the tower of Zenopus to fulfill a job for Gellan, who agrees.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Urgor then makes a visit to Captain Xendros, who's operation is very busy loading salted fish for delivery to the Domain of Iuz.  He shares insults with Goraxan, the dragonborn who he sparred with previously in the bare knuckles match.  Xendros finds him and discusses his quest in more detail.  He learns more about the methods of Iuz and its people.  She offers creating an item for him that would assist in information, or offering to sell him a few powerful magic items.  They make a deal and she orders the item created.  Urgor then visits the docks and approaches a ship's captain of the Iridescent, to learn more about cartography and navigation.  The captain and quartermaster offer to teach Urgor periodically.  He also visits the mariner's guild and learns more about the surrounding lands and seaways.

                                        Arriving at the cliffs of Warthalkeel, Seja and Gerard descend and dive down to find the ruins.  They find the stories of Warthalkeel to be mostly true and try to avoid running into too many hazards.  They meet an undead hag named Yalaga, who still worships the Kraken and told of the downfall.  A priest had shown up and converted worshipers to Procan, but secretly worshiped a god to Slaughter -- the Kraken showed up and took vengeance, which apparently was the whole point for the priest. Anyway, Seja found the temple of procan and fought off mud mephits to find a portal opened that was summoning them, which they destroyed.  He reports back to the Temple to share the good news with Wellgar.  Wellgar takes Seja to the standing stones.

                                        The Ruby Pearl sailed to the tower of Zenopus, south of Saltmarsh and Kell recruited Belizar and two others who volunteered to join him.  They disembarked the main ship and sailed ashore with the goods. When they arrived, the deal went wrong and they were forced to retreat with their lives.  By coincidence, as they were jumping on their jolly boat, Belizar sighted two nearly dead tieflings being hauled to the tower by goblins, and intervened to dispatch them.  They brought the tieflings onboard and returned to the main ship.  One had died and was thrown overboard, the other, Darcaym, was saved by Belizar with a potion of healing.  Vario sent Darcaym to the brig after he refused to tell him further details of his origin or purpose.  Overnight the crew attacked Darcaym and left him unconscious.  It was agreed that Belizar would take responsibility over Darcaym and would take him to a safe house in Saltmarsh, which Vario has allowed Belizar and friends to stay indefinitely.

                                        Visiting Mejdrich Urgor, he learns from him that there was an Archmage Zenopus who helped Keoland expand it's borders long ago but later defected and helped the Sea Princes carve out their own land (from Keoland). He also learns that there was a commander Eliander involved in some battles in the past connected to Dreadwood.  Mejdrich tells Urgor of some challenges selling the loot from the Haunted House.  Leaving to visit Krag again, Urgor resolves a potential brawl between the the dwarves and a mob of locals. Running into Eliander coincidentally, he asks Urgor to visit Burle on his behalf.

                                        While Darcaym lay unconscious Belizar tracked down Seja, Urgor (and Mejdrich -- who refused to help) to the safehouse.  Seja healed Darcaym.</p>

                                    <h3>A boarding party, and, the unnecessary killing of a tiny dragon?</h3>
									<p>
                                        The party reconvenes at the safe house after a week apart on their separate journeys.  Missing a caster, and luckily finding Darcaym in their midst, they invite him to join.  In an unknown land, he agrees.  Urgor informs the group that the smugglers have just been sighted off the bluffs and the party checks in with the city council.  Darcaym transforms himself into a nondescript robed human and Belizar fends of Eliander's questioning about their new party member.  The council authorizes the party to finish off the smugglers and find out where the weapons are being taken.  Seja makes a strong argument for greater healing potions which pisses off Manistrad a little bit.  The party leaves after a brief shopping session in town.  Mason and Frederick, town guards, join the party for support and they set off on horses borrowed from Eliander.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Making good time the party arrives at the haunted house and stake out the sea off the bluffs, looking for any signals.  A healthy discussion on tactics ends with a plan to try to board the ship peacefully with Darcaym acting as Sanbalet and getting the jump on the crew, or avoiding bloodshed.  Urgor makes a cryptic proclamation and then quietly sits by himself until bedtime.  Seja waits at the signal room and around midnight receives a signal.  Using the messaging system they found earlier, he responds to the ship and they prepare their boarding party.  Frederick stays to guard the horses, while Mason plans to stay on the small boat they intend to use to get to the main vessel.  Darcaym uses gust of wind to speed up the journey. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Nearing the ship, the party sights three crewmen on deck who agree to do a little gambling with Belizar and Darcaym before getting to work loading the cargo.  A quick game, one of the crewmen excitedly cheers when he "wins", only to be put to sleep by a spell from Darcaym.  Thinking everyone had fallen asleep, Seja slips that he needs a rope to tie them up -- the battle begins when the remaining crewman draws his sword and the Captain of emerges from below decks to find they were boarded!  Acting quickly, Urgor knocks out the remaining crewman and disables the deck ballista while Belizar sprints over to the doors to seal them off.  A flurry of shouting and movement below decks is heard and the tie-offs are tested. Soon, the battle is joined by the crew including Bloody Bjorn, the Bosun, and deck wizard. Darcaym casually throws two of the sleeping crew off the side of the ship to their death.  A sniper shoots crossbow bolts from the crows nest and three lizard men and a tiny dragon join the fray.  Urgor and Seja hold the line against the majority of the crew, taking damage but giving it out all the same.  Darcaym sends a flaming chromatic orb at the wizard, forcing him to hide at the other end of the ship before being gutted from behind by Belizar who desperately tries to appeal to the dragon to stop fighting.  Seja goes toe to toe with the captain but eventually goes berserk and kills him and the tiny dragon before Darcaym can put him to sleep.  The battle ends as the last lizard man and Bloody Bjorn concede the fight.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        With the battle won, all that can be heard are the heavy breaths of the survivors, splashes from the waves lapping up against the hull, and a snoring Seja, covered in the pulpy aftermath of the captain and the dragon.

                                    <h3>The Sea Ghost cleared, and, Mason fed to the sharks? part 1/2</h3>
									<p>
                                        After an epic fight with the smugglers on the Sea Ghost, the party emerged victorious and set about clearing the decks. They were surprised in the wizards quarters as two suits of animated armor jumped them and nearly took out Urgor. Down to no spells, the party decided to sail out to sea and hunker down to rest. Seja's god Yondalla revealed that his morningstar was cursed. On the late evening, the party then searched the remaining ship compartments finding a stash of more weapons meant for the lizardfolk, along with contraband including wine, brandy, silks, and fine mining equipment. A letter found in the Captains desk confirmed deliveries of 'iron goods' had been going for some time. A crude map found indicated the tribe was located at the mouth of a river in the hook marshes, about 20 miles by land from Saltmarsh to the south. Gorn Ironhide, the lizardman that was captured asked for his freedom or death. He described an upcoming big fight and that the tribe would prevail, but after being threatened by Darcaym, refused to say who they would fight against. A sea elf Oceanus, was found shackled and was freed by the party. He had been tracking the ship for his tribe when he was captured.  He was trying to figure out the meaning of the ship's irregular travel around this part of the coast. He was appreciative of the hospitality provided by the party and asked to try to support the party as they learned more. He said that their tribe had been on cordial terms with lizardfolk in the past, and even traded with them from time to time, but not Gorn's tribe. The party agreed to let Gorn go near the marshes. Bloody Bjorn, the first mate offered information for freedom, but the party didn't trust him and decided to bring him back to Saltmarsh.

                                        Steering inland, the Sea Ghost travelled for around an hour before Oceanus and Belizar sighted Sahuagin making a beeline to them. Around 10 of them boarded around the sides of the ship including a spell caster. Urgor and Oceanus defended the bow and, with the Anchor, Urgor knocked off one which was smashing its warhammer into the hull. On the main deck Darcaym blasted two that were boarding with a lightning chromatic orb before putting them asleep. Seja, taking damage went into a bezerker rage and got swarmed by several warriors. Meanwhile Belizar attempted to defend the helm and Mason at the aft, mostly hitting air but managing to throw one off the aft castle by tying him up quickly to the mizzenmast. Mason fought of repeated attempts but was eventually shoved off the boat in into a swarm of small (young) Sahuagin, to his death. The remaining Sahuagin retreated. Licking their wounds the party sailed back with the Sea Ghost arriving in Saltmarsh late morning.

                                    <h3>Priorities, and, the council ponders war?</h3>
									    While sailing back to Saltmarsh, the party discussed their priorities. 
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                There was general unease with the people on the council.  Urgor thought Eliander could be trusted.  Seja and Belizar said that Gellan might be doing some smuggling, but they should be careful revealing anything and think of the politics of doing so.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The Tower of Zenopus was related to Keledek the Unspoken.  In Belizar's last side quest, Kell, a sea mage, was bringing dead bodies to a contact of Keledek, located at the tower.  Some of these bodies turned into zombies.  Further undead involvement was assumed.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Belizar asked about Darcaym's origins and his plans/goals.  He didn't say too much (he didn't know how he got to Zenopus) but DID mention that he may have to do some things that he cannot explain why.  He said that he either had to save or damn a bunch of souls.
                                            </li>

                                                Party discussed the need to talk with the mariner's guild more about the Sahuagin and learn about what they know.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Blood Bjorn -- Darcaym was tasked with guarding him while they sailed back and Bjorn tried to make him a deal.  Darcaym promised he would live if he told Eliander the whole truth.  Arriving in saltmarsh, the plan was to bring Eliander on the ship and ask him to question Bjorn first, as the rest of the council was 'not to be trusted'.  As it worked out, once news of Mason was received, Eliander was very saddened and told the party to just bring him and the boat into Saltmarsh and that he would interrogate him while in jail at Saltmarsh.  Darcaym made a plea to not kill him, but Eliander said he'd have to have compelling evidence that Bjorn should not be sentenced for his crimes.

                                                At this point Seja explained that he is having trouble maintaining control and needs to go see Wellgar for healing/treatment -- leaving all other matters in the hands of the party.  Frederick left with him.
                                            </li>

                                                Urgor revealed an amulet embedded in his chest and explained that shard of a wizard named Yahui was in there and could contact him telepathically.  Urgor said that he was quite knowledgeable and would answer his questions.  Urgor asked about the curse that Seja was affected with.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                            Marines from Saltmarsh helped Sea Ghost in.  Eliander, Eda, and Gellan, who were attending a festival for the changing of seasons (on the main street and involving rare roasted clams) identified the ship instead as the Untamed Tempest due to its unique figurehead.  This was a former ship of the Keoland Royal Navy that was lost some months ago. With their return, the council members informed the party that a meeting would soon be held.  Oceanus was taken by Gellan and treated as a foreign dignitary.  Eliander took custody of Bjorn and agreed to question him personally.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        The party split up until the meeting.

                                            <li>Urgor enjoyed the festival and ran into Lankus Kurrid, the owner of the Wicker Goat.  He informed Urgor that his bill for his room was past due and recent tax hikes in the Kingdom increased the amount.  Urgor paid double the estimate (50gp).  He made a quick stop at the Blacksmith and met with Mafera who sold him a long-sword.  Arriving early at the meeting, Urgor entered and made his acquaintance with Espira Burnside, the commander of the crown military forces at Seaton.</li>

                                            The council meeting was well attended.  The council members questioned the party about the smugglers, the lizardfolk, the weapons and concluded that it was critical that they know if the build up was a threat to Saltmarsh. They asked the party to investigate, but cautioned against assuming they were hostile.  Oceanus' knowledge of the lizardfolk, though limited, suggested they were mostly isolationists.  The party agreed, for 600 gp, to investigate this threat.  The council would provide appropriate supplies either by land or sea.  Additional resolutions:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Anders proposed creating a zone of avoidance for commerce around the marsh for the time being.</li>
                                            <li>Darcaym pleaded for the release of Bjorn.  The council agreed to a vote, but ultimately Eliander argument prevailed -- he would be hanged soon for the smuggling of Royal property.</li>
                                            <li>Manistrad suggested reinforcing the static defenses in Saltmarsh, but only after the threat was known (due to expenses). Eliander suggested increasing the size of the town guard from 20 to 25 and the marines from 8 to 15.  Both these resolutions needed further discussion among the council.  Eliander also noted that he needed to recruit for a new constable following Mason's death.</li>
                                            <li>Ownership of the Untamed Tempest was discussed. The party suggested that they ought to get it.  Espira Burnside discussed the military need for vessels and claimed ownership.  The party suggested that they could act on behalf of Saltmarsh defense (which lacked a significant navy).  The council agreed to discuss further.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                            Following the meeting, the party was approached by Council member Eda Oweland who suggested that good folk like the party members were welcome here in Saltmarsh and that they should consider settling down.  She offered to discuss politics or current happenings on the following day (or whenever) should the party desire her opinion.  She also mentioned that it was Gellan who kept the discussion open about the ship and had asked her to extend an invite to a dinner at his place that evening to discuss it further.

                                            Seja has an out of body experience and, after meeting up with the party they have dinner at Gellan's mansion.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After checking in with Wellgar, Seja passes out and then wakes up in alternate version of Saltmarsh, Marshland Grove.  Although Wellgar healed him, a curse still remains.  Seja also appears to have turned into a goblin, and Wellgar a hobgoblin.  They go on a walk through town.  Marshland grove is a grim place with many buildings in state of disrepair, a darkness and pall of death and smoke throughout the town.  Screams are heard in the distance and Wellgar explains this to be the work of a vampire spawn of the Holstien's.  With respect to the curse, he explains that the morningstar was cursed by Erythnul, god of slaughter, panic, and hate but also by Procan, for taking it from the sea. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Wellgar says "Procan's domain is the sea, and whatever the oceans touch, he bears witness to. His mood shifts to darkness as he witnesses a brutal murder on the docks of a squalid port, then lifts in pride as he watches a brave mariner leap into the sea and save a drowning child. Every story of the oceans courses through his mind, and he in each moment curses and blesses mortals for their endless follies, heroism, and hatreds. At sea, he expects sacrifices in the form of fine food, potent alcohol, or valuable treasures thrown overboard at the start of a voyage. Due to this ritual, Procan holds all treasures lost at sea as part of his domain. He curses those who plunder shipwrecks without the blessings of his clerics, dogging their steps with wretched weather until his attention is drawn elsewhere."  In order to fully lift the curse, Procan has to be pleased in some way (saving a damsel in distress, etc.).  Seja visits young "Flanders" who recently told Wellgar about a lost ship that was sighted.  On his way back to the temple Seja then sees a bright white wisps that form a cord overhead and seems to land at the standing stones.  When he gets close he sees two more, three in total.  One heads due North, the others to the Southwest.  He runs to the standing stones to find what appears to be three translucent undead women held in a perpetual screaming state, hair flared out, one at each stone.  Between the stones is a bright white disc glowing with power.  As Seja stands on it, his surroundings disappear and are replaced with pure whiteness all around him and  he hears a deep voice that says to him: "So you are Seja. I am... Magnificus."  Seja then wakes up back in the Temple (as himself) and wonders if it was all just a dream?  Yondalla seems to have lessened the power of the curse on the morningstar.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party reconvened at Gellan's Mansion.  Belizar stopped by Kester's Leather Goods and asked Kiora to join him to dinner.  At Gellan, the councilman avoided all talk of business until after an extravagant dinner and a dance-off occurred.  Urgor narrowly eeked out a "victory" over Seja with Belizar helping out on the pan flutes.  After dinner the party drank a rare magical drink called Mithat Swirl which created smoke prophecies for each party member.  Urgor got the "twisted mountain" -- Gellan described this as a challenge which cannot be achieved.  Seja got "blood on water" which is related to chaos.  Belizar got "taut rope", or excitment and risk taking AND took another drink and got "a gold coin turning to a patina" which represents a great debt (perhaps personal).

                                            Finally coming to a business discussion the party asked Gellan his idea around getting the ship.  He advised that they really had three problems and offered a deal.
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                Perception/Politics -- to improve the perception of the party he suggested a "brand name" that the people and Leadership of Saltmarsh could get behind and who would, with conviction, protect Saltmarsh when called upon.  The party landed on "The Servant" and agreed they would.  He advised them to accept a small contingent from Seaton of marines to serve on the vessel to appease Espira. Gellan told the party that if they could get Eliander on their side, the council could be convinced, and that this would be the key.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Bureaucracy -- The merchant guild requires a lengthy and costly process to get high enough membership to own and operate a vessel.  Gellan's grandfathered agreement could be used to get around this.  He'd need to do the formal hiring of crew in order to do this.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                               Finances -- maintenance, crew, repairs, supplies, improvements, and mooring were all expensive.  He estimated 200-400gp in repairs, 100gp/mo mooring, 50gp/day for crew and supplies.  Gellan would help secure the logistics of operating the ship in return for their assistance trading (since he's just lost a vessel).  He assured them all business would be legal, but the ship had to turn a profit.  The party could use the boat for adventuring or their other business as they saw fit. 
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
                                            In return, Gellan would own the boat at the end of 1 year. The party agreed to this arrangement.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After an evening of needed rest, the Belizar and Urgor visited Eda Oweland while Seja visited Anders regarding his out of body experience.  Eda was doing some work at her warehouse packing fish and asked for help while the group discussed the local politics.  She offered some insight into the history of the Hold of the Sea Princes -- that they used to be part of Keoland and had broken away some years ago and that there are actually a handful sea princes that collectively rule.  The regional areas around the Kingdom of Keoland apparently also broke away some years after the Sea Princes (see Mysteries and Histories section).  Finally she mentioned that no one ever figured out why some of the workers at the docks were going blind.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Meanwhile Seja surprised Anders when he told him that he knew that there was a vessel thought lost associated with him that had a priest of Procan on it.  Anders had apparently received news that it had been sighted South of Gyrax in the Bay of Keoland.  Additionally, Anders said that other wrecks might be known at the Mariner's guild.  Anders said that the vessel was owned by an associate of his parents before they died and was known to contain some valuables in a secure box.  He offered Seja 200gp to recover it.

                                    <h3>A tiefling gone an elf introduced, and, a diplomatic entry?</h3>
                                        The party had a bit of business in town before heading out to Dunwater river and approaching the lizardfolk.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Seja was busy crafting poisons for the evening
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The group decided that the quest to find Ander's ship that was recently sighted adrift would have to wait -- and so with it, lifting Seja's curse.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Urgor and Belizar meanwhile went discuss the ship with Eliander.  After some discussion, Urgor convinced Eliander to support their bid to take ownership over the boat, with the stipulation that they would take on the marines from Seaton.  The party promised the ship would not become a financial burden on Saltmarsh and would serve to protect it from seaborn threats when called upon.  Eliander said he would let them know how the council meeting goes on their return.
                                            </li>

                                                Belizar saw Gellan who asked him to disable the animated armor guarding the ship, there was no way to undertake repairs and alterations safely until they are calmed.
                                            </li>

                                                While at the Hoolwatch tower, Belizar saw Charles taking down notes on an apparent scene of a crime.  Last night at the jail, Darcaym met with Bloody Bjorn and sat with him for hours.  Charles thought it was "a rather pathetic affair" as Darcaym methodically asked about Bjorn's every misdeed and pleaded with him be better.  Finally, Darcaym left, asking where to find a horse, and Charles locked up the jail behind him.  The next morning Charles found Bjorn dead with three large black holes in his neck, with three darts found in the cell.  After inquiring at Winston's general store, where he went to buy a horse, it seems that Darcaym was nowhere to be found.
                                            </li>

                                                Belizar and Urgor followed up with Winston, who, after a few gold, mentioned that Darcaym mentioned Kiara Shadowbreaker, Burle, and Niole Dra.  He sold Darcaym his best horse with gear and a couple weeks worth of rations as well as a map of Keoland
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Eliander also introduced Elluin, a wood-elf druid, who was recommended by Kiara Shadowbreaker and has asked to help the party.  The party agreed and they got to know each other over several meals at the Wicker Goat Tavern.  Elluin stayed in a nearby grove of trees that clearly had a druid tending it.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        With their business settled the party left by Sea the following morning.  Although the weather was sub-standard, the boat hugged the coast and made its way to the spot marked on the map in around 5 hours or so.  There were two notable events:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                In hawk form, Elluin spotted A blue dragon and winged kobolds chasing several large Pteranodons over an archipelago in the distance.  The party decided to settle down in a cove at the Tower of Zenopus until this resolved. 
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                In hawk form, Elluin spotted A blue dragon and winged kobolds chasing several large Pteranodons over an archipelago in the distance.  The party decided to settle down in a cove at the Tower of Zenopus until this resolved.

                                        </ul>
                                        Arriving at the expected location for the lizardfolk village, Elluin returned to hawk form to do some further scouting.  The land surrounding the delta at the end of the Dunwater river was marshy and wet.  A few small, dryer, trails were found, but little in the way of obvious clues of habitation.  Cave entrances to a hill, rising out of the marsh was found.  On the inland entrance giant lizards slept at the entrance.  At the sea entrance, lizardfolk guards were sighted.  They were speaking about some discussion in the tribe with Merfolk and Kaolinths.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        After some discussion on how to proceed, the party decided that they would treat this as a diplomatic mission and assume the lizardfolk would not immediately attack them.  They entered via the sea entrance and confronted the guards.  Belizar played his flute and one by one everyone dropped their weapons at the insistence of the guards (well... Seja's morningstar was removed and Elluin took a couple of javelins for his reluctance).  The guards then escorted the party to the Queen Othokent who asked their business.  Urgor insisted that they were here as representative from Saltmarsh and could trade weapons if desired but needed to know the lizardfolk's intent.  He reasoned that they may have mutual enemies.  The queen was persuaded to consider the party non-threatening, but provided little information.  Instead she authorized the party to stay for a time at the village and speak with the people, whom she would consult with as well, and then decide what she intends to do with you.

                                    <h3>Courting the Lizardfolk, and, Dead by the Bullywugs?</h3>
								        In the lizardfolk village the party spoke to several different groups to determine their intentions and gain goodwill.  They learned quickly that the lizardfolk were not preparing to attack Saltmarsh at all -- in fact they were building an alliance to launch an attack on the Sahaugin instead. Suariv's, an elderly and well-spoken diplomatic minister to the queen, told them that the Sahaugin appeared several months ago and drove the lizardfolk tribe from their ancestral home, killing many in the process.  Since then, they have grown in strength and threatened the region.  The party then set off to gain the favor of various groups in the tribe.
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                SAURIV -- Sauriv also mentioned that it was he who arranged the purchase of the weapons (unbeknownst to him that they were stolen), and arranged to meet the other sea races.  He told the party that land-dwellers were generally not thought of as that effective against Sahaugin, but was open to the possibility of allying. The party would need to convince the other groups in order sway the Queen.
                                            </li>

                                                WARRIORS -- They found several the warriors in the kitchen.  Although the first group nearly mistook them as intruders, the second group was more social.  Seja was given the name of  Zundae (mirthful/joker), for some good jokes.  Between the drinking, discussion of tactics, and a gift from Seja of three longswords, they found the party good company.  However, the boasting of martial prowess was met with a challenge for Urgor to personally to defeat Thousand Teeth -- a powerful giant crocodile they cannot kill (due to a restriction from their god) but has been terrorizing the marsh.

                                                COMMONERS -- Commoners were playing with their hatchlings when the party arrived.  The young ones took to the music and dancing of Belizar and Seja.  The party learned that they felt less safe in their current location versus the old home.  Many hatchlings were orphaned when the Sahaugin attacked.  They also spoke of threats in the swamp -- Ogres, trolls, bandits, bullywugs, and Thousand Teeth.  They suggested that Thousand Teeth was very powerful and would require 10 or more to bring down.  Urgor was called Uthrax (growing) and Belizar Mirik (song).
                                            </li>

                                                SHAMAN -- Several shaman in the temple were praying to their God Semuanya when the party arrived.  It was clear that they, unlike others in the tribe, did not want an alliance to other races, saying that it would displease their god.  Self-reliance and survival were highly valued.  They were pretty much outright racists against other races. They mentioned that Bullywugs had stolen a magical artifact from them in -- a helm of underwater breathing -- and would like it returned.  They also mentioned Thousand teeth.  Finally, they offered to help Seja remove his berserker curse, but he would need to sacrifice an enemy to Semuanya and draw some of his own blood.

                                                Sea-races - the party questioned each of the prospective alliance members about their forces, experience with the Sahuagin, and answered questions about Saltmarsh.

                                                        Sea-elves (Kelpy) - Kelpy explained that he had just arrived, later than the other groups because the Kaolinths had previously been asked to join the alliance (and they would not ally with the sea-elves under any circumstance).  With this relationship breaking down, the sea-elves approached the lizardfolk. He was tired and didn't offer much information other than the sea elves were concerned about the Sahaugin, and asked about the military capabilities of Saltmarsh.

                                                        Merfolk - The merfolk here were previously refugees from a faraway sea and joined with another clan that lives near some islands nearby.  They noted that the Suahagin had grown more aggressive of late and see them as a threat.
                                                    </li>

                                                        Locathah - The locathah were nomads but managed to establish a small village in the kelp forests nearby.  They were quite skittish.  Their people have been slaves to many races and weren't all to unhappy with it if the nature of the slavery was not too severe.  Nonetheless, the Sahuagin were seen as killers and had threatened their people.

                                                        Kaolinth (Sea goblins) - Little discussion occured here.  They were unhappy with the Queen suggesting the sea-elves might be approached and broke off discussion with the lizardfolk.  They were preparing to leave when the party questioned them.  They would not speak to Belizar.  Urgor who mentioned that the sea-elves would be fighting the Sahuagin and would be victors in the upcoming battle, to which the Sahaugin said they would be expecting that many may also die and this would leave the sea-elves weaker.
                                                    </li>

                                         </ol>
                                        The party then resolved to undertake two tasks with the permission of the queen -- kill Thousand Teeth, and find the Bullywugs and return the artifact, starting with the latter.

                                    <h3>Bullywugs</h3>
                                            The party successfully traversed the marsh, a 3 hour journey which, among other things, involved Seja eating marsh herbs and going a short hallucinogenic trip, and Urgor tracking the Bullywugs, and Belizar sneaking up to assess their numbers.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Outnumbered at least 3:1, the party hoped to lure a group of Bullywugs and put a silence spell on them in order to incapacitate one and bring him back to the lizardfolk village. Belizar started the chase, but things went sideways, when the silence spell was accidentally stopped and the fight with the small group didn't go down easy. Seja stayed in the rear, slinging spells and hoping to avoid going berserk.  Finally the Bullywug King entered the fray with his giant toad.  Belizar tried to kited off the new group with Seja's supporting spells and manage to hide and then sneak up on the King.  Meanwhile Urgor cleaved left and right, constantly surrounded.  A group step up and threw their spears at Seja, finally injuring him and sending him into berserker mode.  They regretted this as he charged and in short order killed everyone one of them off.  The King, in response to Belizar's bold attack bucks the toad and turned to Belizar and crit him with a deep stab of his massive spear -- Belizar goes down.  Urgor rushes to Belizar and stabilizes him.  With their numbers thinning he turns to face down Seja and Urgor who swing at him from every angle.  The toad snapping at Urgor, tries to swallow him and spits up a poison, nearly bringing Urgor down.  Seja wails into the King, bashing him off his mount and sending his crown flying. But the Giant Toad responds with a bite that brings Seja down.  Exhausted, burning from the acid and stab wounds and nearly on his last breath, Urgor cuts down the toad.  With his allies dying, he quickly rummages through Seja's bag and finds his two potions of healing and administers them.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Moments later the Toad regurgitates the bullywug's treasure: 325 pp in a small chest and a magnificent looking helm that Seja promptly puts on.

                                            The party makes for the lizardfolk village before dark with no further encounters and considers whether Seja will actually go through with the ritual.

                                    <h3>Seja's sacrifice, and, ticks in the swamp.</h3>
									
                                        Elluin's time in the village while the rest of the party was gone was primarily spent questioning the lizardfolk on what they know of the regional threats.  They appeared to have little involvement in regional issues.  They knew nothing of Dreadwood or the Sea Princes.  They discussed threats in the marsh and warned against the Tower of Zenopus (undead presence) and the drowned forest (evil forces -- demonic?). 

                                        Before the sacrifice could ensue, Belizar tried to recover a sword that he noticed was stuck in the mud in the entrance to the Lizardfolk village.  Speaking with the guards, he found out that the giant lizards were pretty much pets.  With the lizards at ease, he simply picked up the weapon, which turned out to be a magical scimitar called illumina.  Belizar traded off his rapier to the guard for it.

                                        <h3>The sacrifice</h3>
                                        Seja met with the shamans who taught him the basics of the upcoming sacrifice.  There were many intricacies, steps, and words he had to memorize.  He and the shamans discussed their experience with rituals.  Seja got himself hyped up and the ritual finally began.  There was a lot of circling and chanting to Semuanya. The shaman lit small flames in their hands and the mural to their god shimmered.  Finally the captive bullywug was brought in.  Seja started to pull out his morningstar but was told he had to kill him by hand.  Throttling the bullywug, he gripped hard until it was strangled.  Then he was told to draw his own blood.  Again he reached for his morningstar, but was told he had to draw blood without a weapon. Biting his own hand, a few drops fell onto the body.  At that moment, the berserker curse lifted, but, along with it this connection with Yondalla.  Relieved but newly anxious, Seja decided to drink himself to sleep in the kitchen after devouring all the living creatures in it (he found a new craving for raw meat).  Elluin found him in the night and returned him to their room.

                                        <h3>The trek through the swamp</h3>
                                        The party travelled through the swamp by foot.  Jhank, a lizardfolk captain, offered to provide some support navigating the marsh, but warned that he only had knowledge of the nearby area.  The party accepted.  Seja prayed to Yondalla, but there was no response.  Climbing a nearby tree, Urgor spotted a dry path that they could travel on for a time.  With the vegetation becoming denser, Elluin cast minor easy path which cleared the way for around an hour.  As evening neared, Jhank suggested they try to stop by some `traders' that he knew of which lived in the swamp.  The party made for the their shack.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Nectrotic ticks and zombies</h3>
                                        When they arrived, they found dead bodies instead of traders.  Worse, yet they were recently turned zombies that had been attacked by necrotic ticks.  A battle broke out.  A tick attached to Belizar for sometime and he found that while it hurt him, it also healed him at the same time with a weird necrotic energy.  A zombie horse came galloping around the shack and tried to nip at Seja.  Jhank was outnumbered but managed to stay alive with healing from Elluin. Urgor did Urgor things and the enemies piled up.

                                    <h3>A Thousand Teeth removed, and, an ambush in the night.</h3>
								        Picking up at the shack in the swamp the party stayed overnight to heal their wounds.  Not before Urgor collected and burned the bodies and Belizar collected some delicious hool swamp cabbage and caught a cat fish for dinner.  Inside the shack were the few belongings of what appeared to be bandits.  In a small chest 2 navigator kits and a few weapons were found.

                                        <h3>Thousand teeth</h3>
                                            Knee deep in the bog, the party decided to hunt down a giant toad to use as bait.  Urgor and Belizar fashioned a hook of sorts and wrapped around the toad carcass.  Urgor bent a few short swords.  Meanwhile, Elluin snuck up to the pond and scouted out some massive snakes in the trees.  Returning unnoticed he rejoined the party.  As the group stealthily advanced on the pond, a sudden ripple on the water indicted something had noticed their presence. At this time Elluin mentioned the snakes.  Everyone found cover as Belizar gave the toad one shove a few feet away from their hiding spot.  Closing in on the Toad, an enormous crocodile blasted out of water and with one bite, tore the toad in half. Another bite later, he swallowed the second half (swords with it).  The party sprang the trap -- Urgor wrestling down the tail, determined to hack it off, Seja casting aid and spritual weapon, Elluin bringing down a moonbeam, and Belizar pulling against the rope on the sword trap to do internal damage.  Sensing danger, Thousand teeth rolled and disturbed some swarms of poisonous snakes which, keeping their distance from the croc, engaged the party.  Finally Urgor hacked its tail and the beast went down.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party, helped by Jhank, investigated the pool to see if any treasures had accumulated.  The only problem were the giant snakes in the trees.  With some quick thinking Elluin (the badger) persuaded the snakes to hold while they prepared a tasty crocodile.  They hastily hacked off some quarters of meat and left it for the snakes who were satiated. Back the pool, the party dived, dredged and dug through the lair finding a suit of serviceable half-plate, some gold, and a ring of obscuring.

                                        <h3>An accusation over the stolen artefact</h3>
                                            The party travelled back through the Marsh with no incident.  They stumbled across a group of lizardfolk, of another tribe, undergoing some ritual of Semyuana.  Later, they went around a dense fog, helped along by a compass.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Finally they arrived back at the village but the victory celebrations were held up due to the shaman finding the tribe's artefact, the helm of underwater breathing, in the room of the party.  Urgor was accused of stealing it.  The party tried to argue that they collect many items and didn't know this was THE helm (this one was far inferior to the helms they have in Saltmarsh, etc).  The penalty for theft was 100 moons of service or the loss of a hand (the honorable warrior treatment).  The Queen was consulted.  The Urgor and Belizar pleaded their case, with the Queen finally deciding they were not being honest and had to be punished.  Belizar offered a 100 moons of service but that it would be spaced out over some time and begin after the alliance was formed.  This compromised was accepted by the Queen and the party was back in good faith with the tribe.  A night of celebration ensued followed by a well-deserved rest...

                                        <h3>Sahaugin on the loose & saving the queen</h3>
                                            ...in which the party was woken up in the middle of the night as Elluin heard a scuffle down the passageways and a cry from the Queen's guards.  Waking the party and then racing down the passages he saw Sahuagins standing over the corpses of the queen's guard.  With a gust of wind, he blew the assassins down the hallway slowing their advance and giving his party time to catch up.  With the wind at his back Urgor piled into the Sahaugin cleaving through them with Belizar hot on his heels. Seja ran as fast as his wee legs could carry him.  Urgor made short work of the brawny sharkman, knocking him out for further questioning, and Belizar darted into the Queen's quarters to find her under attack, her guards all slain.  The party cleaned them up and healed the queen, recieving her heartfelt thanks. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            In the aftermath the party and village did a headcount and found that the Sahaugin had been released from prison, while Kelpy the sea-elf had disappeared.  Urgor, with Seja's healing help, tortured the surviving enemy.  Torture consisted of fresh water boarding and eventually lopping off its hands.  Falling in and out of consciousness and healed back to life, eventually the Lizardfolk called the torture off before much could be learned.

                                            Leaving the village the party discussed the upcoming activities in Saltmarsh and region.  Resolving whether Oceanus was a spy or not was deemed important and would be handled by Urgor and Elluin.  The party resolved to check in on Mejdrich and learn more about what is known about the Tower of Zenopus.  Urgor asked Yahui more about the Keledek's arcane interests to which he responded that he was a generalist with some interest in necromancy, but has some interest in Zenopus who was a necromancer.  After discussing necromancy a bit, Elluin noted that he was adamantly opposed to it and asked the party to imagine their own families reanimated as undead.  Belizar mentioned that he had done a job for Gellan which involved dropping off corpses at the Tower of Zenopus. Elluin questioned Belizar's intentions and foreknowledge of the job.  Belizar said that he got in over his head but was by no means a friend to the undead.  Silence ensued...

                                        <h3>Keelboat Ride Home</h3>
                                            Jory reported out that 3 vessels were seen making what appeared to be quick drop-offs some ways up the coastline.  They kept hidden and avoided these ships so it was unclear who they were and what their business was.  All the ships were considerably bigger than Jory's Keelboat.  The drop-offs took around 2 hours.  Upon getting close to the Tower of Zenopus, a large sailboat was at anchor some 300-400 feet off coast.  As keelboat rowed inland and tried to pass where it was too shallow for the larger boat, a jollyboat emerged from the Zenopus bay mists, blocking their path.  The party retreated to the shallow waters near the lizardfolk village and waited for several hours.  With the larger sailboat sailing off to the south, and, not appearing to return, they continued their journey back to Saltmarsh without any further disruption, arriving in the early evening.  The party noted that the Untamed Tempest was well under repair with scaffolding all up the sides of the ship.  Finally, several party members noticed wanted signs looking for Darcaym posted in the social houses.

                                            Elluin and Urgor went straight to Gellan to ask some questions of Oceanus who was being hosted there.  After Elluin insisted on asking questions alone with Oceanus, refusing to speak with Gellan beforehand, and casting a spell of animal control, Gellan kicked him out.   It was only briefly however -- after Urgor vouched for Elluin and his story he was recalled and returned to discuss the matter at hand. Gellan recounted Oceanus' stay and that he had no reason to think that Oceanus was insincere. He noted that he had left for a short period to return to his tribe but returned just yesterday.  At the suggestion of Urgor and Elluin, Oceanus was questioned before the council meeting.  Oceanus professed no knowledge of Kelpy and insisted that his tribe were awaiting was was learned of the party's adventure before contacting the Lizardfolk.  At this point Elluin recalled what he'd learned about Malenti, Sahaugin that looked identical to sea-elves (except their junk) and often served as spies.  With this as a working assumption, they left Gellan's place and retired for the evening.

                                        <h3>Getting to know Ivar and Lorys a little better at the Grove of Obad-Hai</h3>
                                            Elluin returned to the Sea Grove of Obad-Hai and met Ivar Kastelar a gnome and druid of the coast who, along with Lorys the toad, tended to the forest.  He offered that Elluin could stay in the forest that evening and they spoke about the forests in the region.  Loyrs apparently ran the forest and was an old druid who shapeshifted into a toad and now prefers that form.

                                            Ivar said that he told the council of Saltmarsh a few years ago that Khmaz the Traveler (An adult blue dragon) would come to the region from the dry steppes to stay at the Carrion Archipelago, but they did not listen to him.

                                            Seja visited the standing stones and began copying the runes which spanned the edges of each stone on a parchment paper, hoping that they could be translated by Elluin.  Nearing completion he was surprised by Dallah Thuan who came to talk to him about his recent activities.  She was pleased by Seja's attempted theft of the helm and confirmed that it was a Malenti who foiled her plans by taking the helm from Seja.  She gave Seja a minor boon -- the ability once a week to make any item that he holds invisible for 10 minutes.  Finally she asked if Seja wanted to meet a being that could help with the vision Yondalla sent him and who was a master of astral pathways.  Seja was curious.  Dallah Thuan said she would agree to put him in contact if he would steal some power from this being.  Ultimately she said that Seja would have the choice to do so, but it would be a different relationship than with Yondalla.

Kiora said she would begin the work and asked if the visit was entirely business.  Belizar then invited himself over to dinner making an unbelievable beaver tail stew and entertaining Kiora throughout the evening with his bone pipes.  They ended the evening on good terms, with Belizar learning a bit more about home ownership in Saltmarsh.

                                                    It has been known to have an abbey to some wicked god and has been avoided by Saltmarsh as long as anyone can remember.  There are rumours of undead.

                                                    The council thinks that this might be a good opportunity to claim this island and would therefore like the party to clear it first.

                                                    Manistrad also mentioned privately that the Copperlocks Clan has an old story of a very large gem that was found there and thus thinks there could be some good mining.

                                            The party did not commit to this, but expressed interest and told her that they would return to discuss further. Manistrad said that there was likely time as work underway in Saltmarsh would first need to be completed.

                                        <h3>The Repairs underway with the Untamed Tempest & the business</h3>
                                            The party caught up with Gellan later that day to discuss the work on the Untamed tempest and other business:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    The upper deck was complete and the party could stay on the Untamed Tempest if they chose to do so.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Gellan returned the animated armor coin
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Repairs will cost 400gp and will be complete in about 1 1/2 weeks.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Around half the crew has been hired (10 sailors), the 5 royal mariners from Seaton are now in Saltmarsh and ready to board, and a cook (Yarn the Butcher, from Ander's staff).  Finally, Frederick has devised a net system to be used on the ship and has been hired as the cabin boy.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    The party confirmed their deal with Gellan and agreed that there was some risk involved.  He suggested the party think of themselves as a company and keep a joint treasury.  Finally the party calculated the costs involved and came up with 15,000 gp / year to operate the ship.  Gellan said that he's made double that amount easy on a ship like this per year.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Last, Gellan asked to split the cost for commissioning of Books of Sending, which allows writing in one book to be immediately seen in the other book and has no range limit.  The total cost would be 1000gp and the party would need to provide 500gp.  The party agreed to commission this with Mejdrich/Keledek.
                                                </li>

                                    <h3>Clues of Arkon, Seja's Prayers, An unexpected reunion, and, a battle at the beach?</h3>
								        <h3>Namaneed's visit</h3>
                                            Namaneed, more or less an uncle to Belizar, found the party and suggested that he, Belizar and Elluin catch up at the Snapping Line.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            He pointed Elluin to Gendal'ii, a silverwood elf ranger, who was staying just out side town.  She delivered a message to Elluin to return to Silverwood when his mission was complete as there was a need for him to help with issue in the Drowned Forest and the little people (Halflings).  He scribbled out some notes on his current mission, with it more or less complete, and asked her to deliver them to Akkrila (Lord of War for Silverwood Elves). 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Namaneed and Belizar caught up.  Namaneed left the Wild Coast shortly after Belizar -- trouble with the law.  He had been helping out the Silverwood elves and came to find Belizar to see what he was doing now.  He warned of dangers out of Dreadwood (undead, dire wolves, bandits) and that the Elves and Kiara were unsettled with these incursions.  He also mentioned that he was looking to settle down and figure out a new line of work -- Belizar suggested he join with the Untamed Tempest.  Finally he said that he had some personal news in which he needed to meet with both Belizar and Eda as soon as possible.  They made a plan for the next morning to do so.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            At the Tavern was a dwarven bard who had a story about a Tiefling nicknamed "soul whisperer" who travels the land, coming and going, saving souls.  She said it was a borrowed story from another bard in Niole Dra (Capital).
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Keledek's tower, part I</h3>
                                            Urgor, Seja and Frederick then visited the Tower of Keledek to find it quiet and no one came to the door.  There were several peculiarities -- when reaching about 15 feet from the tower itself a threshold of force could be felt, and, around the edges of the tower were scaffolding boards levitating in mid-air.  Urgor decided to check one of the windows and and found Mejdrich studying, deep into his books and scrolls.  Knocking on the window he gave Mejdrich a start, but they then had a chat about possibly entering -- Mejdrich said that another time would probably be better and that Urgor should be careful climbing up the tower in the night (Keledek wouldn't take kindly to it).  Urgor briefly mentioned the Sending Books before leaving.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Stopping in to see Xendros</h3>
                                            Urgor left Seja and Frederick and checked in on Xendros at the Faithful Quartermaster's of Iuz.  Although it appeared she was expecting someone else (dressed in a skimpy nightgown), she decided to see Urgor asking if he came for business or pleasure.  In a flash, he violently kissed her in a moment of passion.  But, business won out as he abrubtly changed subjects and asked to see her magical items.  She returned two swords, a helmet, and a suit of armor which were all too expensive for Urgor.  Disappointed on both fronts, Xendros wished Urgor a pleasant evening and suggested he visit her again.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Prayers at the Temple of Procan</h3>
                                            Frederick found Seja at the ship and asked if he could tell him a few things about Yondalla.  He also mentioned that there was a cleric of Yondalla, staying at the temple of Procan looking for Seja.  They left to find her.  
                                        <br/><br>
                                            Gwiston Gamwich (aka Sandwich), a young halfing cleric in Seja's order met them at the temple and caught up a bit.  Seja met Gwiston just as he was leaving the Hermitage.  She asked him about his traumatic experience and if he was over it.  Yondalla had given told her that Seja had gone astray and she came to help him reconnect with Her.  They joined in several prayers and Frederick joined.  Gwiston then mentioned some worrisome news -- that the halfings of Heatherholm were anxious about several halfings who, for no good reason, went into the Drowned forest and have not returned.  In the meantime, halfings in the villages have been seeing visions of Seja in their dreams, surrounded by a bright white light, and carrying a flaming morningstar.  After speaking about, Gwiston suggested they stay up through the night in prayer like old times.

                                            Namaneed and Belizar met at Eda's compound and saw her speaking with a group of halflings.  When they left, Eda saw them and was surprised to see Namaneed.  Belizar found out that they know each other well and used to do business together in the past.  Namaneed revealed that Belizar was Eda's son and Eda, shocked, removed her wig and makeup to reveal that she was actually Belizar's father Thadius.  Many years ago he sent Belizar and Belizar's mother Leshanna away to keep them away from danger -- Namaneed agreed to take them to the Wild Coast and they restarted their lives there, while Thadius stayed in Saltmarsh. Leshanna and Namaneed became a couple. Tragically, Leshanna died when Belizar was still young due to a disease. Namaneed tried to get medicine but couldn't help her in time -- so Namaneed raised Belizar for time and always looked after him -- sending him back to Saltmarsh when Belizar got on the wrong side of the law.

                                            Belizar and Eda caught up for a bit but agreed to keep her true identity a secret.

                                        <h3>Krag uncovers some ancient history</h3>
                                            Urgor and Elluin decided to visit Krag at the Saltmarsh cemetery.  Krag introduced himself to Elluin and answered a few questions about the regional politics -- particularly about Seaton.  He learned that the governor of the southern province (which includes Seaton) is Duke Marik Feldren.  He is supposedly fiercely loyal to the king, has a council of advisors.  Seaton has been fortifying/militarizing over the last years -- in years past it was the dominant sea trading hub for Keoland but Saltmarsh has supplanted it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Krag then brought some news for Urgor as he had been searching through Eliander's library for history about Arkon.  He found an old record which indicated a Goliath Champion of Mephistopheles and an infernal force called the Shard which was present in the region around 100 years ago (CY 467-469).  The Shard was based in the Drowned Forest and sacked Burle and the Tower of Zenopus.  Apparently a battle was fought around Burle and Dreadwood called the Battle of Sheldomar Valley in which the Shard was dispersed.  Finally he read elsewhere that there were two commanders of the remnants of the Shard who apparently were hunted but never captured by crown forces: "Horncarver" and "Drover".
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Elluin noticed some druidic marks around the graveyard indicating another druid had been here before.  At first this appeared to be mostly about the history of the people living here -- actually a good mix of traders with diverse backgrounds (Sueloise and Flannaess names and many migrants).  Further study indicated that the Arch-druid of the circle of Twilight Margeon had left these marks and had left a note that at one point around half of the bodies were removed and the graves now lay empty.  He also mentioned that there were Kyuss Worms (note -- Kyuss was known to Elluin as a god of undeath) here buried deep under the graveyard.  He casts a spell that sealed them and prevented them from infecting the corpses.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Keledek's tower, part II</h3>
                                            The party, minus Elluin, then went back to Keledek's tower to discuss the Books of Sending and Mejdrich's research.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Mejdrich seemed like he had just pulled an all-nighter and looked visibly 10-ish years older than last he saw the party.  Mejdrich had been extraplanar treatises and was very excited of the possibility of other worlds.  He spoke of mirror planes, in particular the Feywild and Shadowfell -- crossings to this place from "our" world were relatively common.  But, traveling there was very dangerous, the rules of the mundane world did not always applies.  He also spoke of different elemental planes, upper and lower planes... The party found this rather academic and Belizar told him to take a seat...
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Urgor then asked Mejdrich about his research around Chief Arkon.  Mejdrich said that he had found a few sources and started sifting through his notes:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Some past battles in the region involving a "Great" Champion --- which meant both in strength and size
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The champion was killed in these battles
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The battles occurred around Burle and Dreadwood
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Some of the Champions remains were taken by the infernal forces to the town of Leej (which is located at the base of the Tower of Zenopus).
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                            Seja asked if Mejdrich had uncovered any information regarding his prophecy.  Mejdrich was a bit flustered but pointed out that his prophecy seemed  like it involved planes and he was trying to tell the party about it.  The discussion got cut off however as...
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party began asking questions about the Tower to Mejdrich who, looking visibly uncomfortably, avoided answering them -- but said that Keledek did have some involvement at Zenopus that he shouldn't really talk about.  Keledek then entered the room and quizzed Belizar (casting detect thoughts) on his knowledge of the Tower.  Belizar tried thinking of naked dwarven women, but could not focus hard enough to break Keledek's grip on his thoughts.  Keledek, realizing the party knew much more than they let on, strongly advised them to avoid the tower if they valued their lives.  He had hired adventurers in the past to explore it, more powerful than the party, and none had return. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            At this moment, an invisible creature entered the tower through the window which seemed to be breathing heavily.  It spoke in a raspy voice to Keledek "Master, there are so many bodies already... sea devils are killing in the markets... there is so much blood, heeeheeehe!".  Keledek ordered Mejdrich to go there as the party reacted in haste making their way to the main part of town.

                                    <h3>The Raid of Saltmarsh</h3>
									    <h3>Slaughter at Green Market</h3>
                                            Rushing out of Keledek's tower, the party was overpassed by a flying Mejdrich.  Screaming citizens were fleeing out of the city shouting of Sea-devils and death.  Arriving at the Green Market, the carts were overturned, goods scattered about, and piles of bloody bodies -- murdered citizens and guards of Saltmarsh, lay near the shoreline.  A dozen Sahaugin seemed to be dragging the corpses into the water.  Mejdrich arrived first and cast a spell which seemed to incapacitate several Sahuagin.  He was rushed by a larger one which swiped at him with claw and tooth and broke his concentration. An tiny 2' red winged creature with a stinger tail appeared behind the larger Sahaugin and tried to attack him but bloodied in return in one bite.  It flew off and disappeared.  Meanwhile the party engaged the Sahaugin on the other flank, with Urgor rushing forward towards another bigger one.  Belizar took a flank while Seja cast Sacred flame continuously.  A couple of the guards went down but most of the commoners got away before the Sahaugin were pushed into the sea.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Mejdrich excused himself to return to the tower while the party assessed the situation.   The retreating Sahuagin seemed to be swimming towards the Keelboat which was launched, ill-advised, by the Saltmarsh marines.  They soon came under attack by swarms of Sahuagin.  With only a small fishing vessel, the party decided the marines were beyond hope and took the long way around.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Along the way the town guard had amassed at the weekly market, where more Sahuagin had torn it to shreds.  Scores of bodies were strewn about and the guard too, had taken casualties.  Belizar and Urgor lent their bow and axes to finish off the Sahuagin there.  Seja meanwhile got a head start dashing off to the Untamed Tempest, which was also under attack.

                                        <h3>One hell of a first day</h3>
                                            Meanwhile, at the Untamed Tempest, another pack of Sahuagin were assaulting the docks around the larger ships including both it and the Seaton Warship, King Skotti's Trident.  Nine Lives a tabaxi sailor who had just that day signed on to the crew of the Untamed Tempest was touring the boat while the attack occurred.  Within a minute most of the dockhands in the area were slaughtered -- at least a dozen Sahaugin easily outmatched the town guards.  Among the Sahuagin were 3 of the blue skinned larger Sahaugin were present along with 2 brawny sea devils that were smashing through the hull of the ships, and, Kelpy the Malenti that had initiated the lizardfolk village.  While Nine Lives darted about the boat, going toe to toe with the two brawny sahuagin, Seja, Urgor and Belizar fought them off around the docks.  Belizar snagged a piglet in the market along the way and tossed it in the water, distracting a few.  Kelpy cast a spell that brought in the tide and then swept several of the corpses in the water.  He shot another cowering townsfolk with his crossbow before diving in and submerging under the water.  Urgor and Seja cut a couple Sahaugin down and traded blows with one of the larger ones, who seemed to go into some blood frenzy, snapping his jaws at Urgor.  On the deck of the Untamed Tempest, Nine Lives threw down her bow, which she couldn't hit anything with, and took up her sword.  Still swinging misses, she sheathed it and brandished her claws for the remaining attacks. Fighting off the last sea-devil she urged the party not to intervene -- but  Belizar rushed in to help and gutted him. The remaining Sahuagin retreated.

                                                    Nine Lives met the party.  Later Gellan showed up and told them that she was hired due to some special skills and would be the chief Mystery Liaison when not on the boat (specifics around the split in findings were to be discussed later)

                                                    A quick assessment of town found around 50 or so villagers killed, 10 guards, 5 marines (and captains), 1 keelboat, and a half-dozen other boats.  King Skotti's Trident was damaged worse than the Untamed Tempest, both would require additional repairs.  The partially built guard tower in Crabber's cove was burnt down and several guards killed over there.

                                                    Belizar checked in on Eda, Namaneed, and Kiora, all of which were not hurt during the raid.

                                                    Gellan showed up and was urged by the party to address the raid ASAP... they provided some ideas.  He said a council meeting would be held as soon as things were brought to order.

                                                    The party also found Eliander who granted them a few precious moments.  They told him that working with the lizardfolk to monitor the underwater area in Saltmarsh might be a good idea.  Additionally, they asked that the council consider stocking foodstuffs to distract/throw off the Sahaugin if they were interested in feeding AND that the boats should be covered in copper plates for protection.  Eliander promised to bring these things up.

He told the party that he had other business to attend to around something he had learned about the undead presence in the area.  He said he could be reached via the druid in the Sea Grove to Obad-Hai if need be.  Finally, he noted that he wishes to accompany the part should they visit the Tower of Zenopus.

Belizar stepped in and defused the situation before any blood was spilled.  Oceanus explained that Sahaugin have a perchance for mutation, Nine suggested he go without pants...

                                            Following the raid the party was tasked with investigating the attacks with Charles, in order to be sure about the details.  The party visited several locations:

"Coral Smashers" seemed specialized in wrecking things from coral to ships.  On In addition to their crude warhammers, they also have sharp, hardened bone protrusions along their arms and legs.  Same size as the normal warriors.

No bodies were dragged.	Acid damage on two of them, burned through the armor and skin.  Eyes have what look like a trace of some ash (Seja recognizes this from previous episode of blinding).

                                        <h3>The Council Meeting</h3>
                                            After the investigation, the council reconvened to make some plans:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>PASSED -- (Eliander proposed) Increased watch militia.  Already sent word to Seaton for contingent of marines.  Ingo and his crew have been hired on contract to bolster the guard.</li>
                                                <li>PASSED -- (Eliander) Some of the Militia will be pressed into permanent duty.  Eda/Anders/Gellan note that there will be economics implications. Considering regular training to better equip common citizens. </li>
                                                <li>PASSED -- (All) Formalize alliance with Lizardfolk, Sea Elves, Locathah, Merfolk. Plan an attack on the Sahaugin.</li>
                                                <li>PASSED, then REVOKED -- (All)  ASAP trade weapons to Lizard folk.  Further discussion: no formal trade arrangement, needs the Ironhide tribe to formally take King Skotti as sovereign.) No workaround... </li>
                                                <li>PASSED -- (All) Usk and Jhank will be hired to watch the bay</li>
                                                <li>FAILED -- (Eliander) Using copper to line ships. No money to spare for such frivolities (Manistrad), and the optics (Anders)</li>
                                                <li>PASSED -- (Gellan) Procession planned that evening for for the Lost</li>
                                                <li>FAILED -- (Eliander, for Belizar) Move town inland until defenses can be shored up.</li>
                                                <li>PASSED -- (Eliander) Store of fish meat in the harbor to put off potential future attacks. Eda –- who is going to pay for that?</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            Finally, they asked the party if they would consider prioritizing the following:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Contact Kiara Shadowbreaker in Burle. Inform her of the attack and to request any military support.</li>
                                                <li>Secure Abbey Isle.  Need to talk with the Mariner's Guild. </li>
                                            </ol>
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>The Procession</h3>
                                            Seja was invited to help lead the procession which included a big speech by Eda, a offering to Procan led by Wellgar, a torch procession, a group song led Anders, and everyone mourning.  Nine Lives got the crowd changing for vengeance and the Seja was invited to say a blessing as he was well recognized in town for healing the many wounded.  Seja, surprised, said "Yondalla is good... erhm..." to which someone asked "Who is Yodoli?".  With an assist from Winston (the other halfing in town), he managed to say a few encouraging remarks that got some token claps.
                                            
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>The Mariner's Guild</h3>
                                            At the mariner's guild, Belizar met with the Guild Master regarding the securing of Abbey Isle.  He offered the following information:

                                                <li>As long as anyone can remember there’s been an Abbey on the Isle that’s known to be cursed.  There are rumors of precious items or gold on the island, but nothing confirmed.</li>
                                                <li>Island is about 1 mile long, 1/2 mile wide with tall cliffs nearly all around it.</li>
                                                <li>Various mariners have verified that there was smoke seen from the Abbey around 1 week ago.  Why? Who knows, but it seems that whatever lived in that abbey is now weakened.</li>
                                                <li>Sent a force of soldiers who did not venture far, and finished off a pirate they saw.  The remaining pirates fled on ship and were not pursued.  They don't know who the pirates are.</li>
                                                <li>The only safe approach is a beach called the Skull Dunes (reefs).  The Abbey is (was) located in the center of the island somewhere.</li>
                                                <li>Major Ursa, a contact from the guild, keeps a lighthouse on an island nearby may provide additional information to whomever takes the contract.</li>
                                                <li>1200gp reward.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            Gellan met with Urgor, Seja, and Belizar to make plans regarding the ship.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The damage from the battle will add a couple of days to repairs.  He's increased the wages of the workers to make sure they don't get persuaded to work elsewhere.</li>
                                                <li>He will make plans to stock up on some food that can be used to through the Sahuagin off if pursued at sea.</li>
                                                <li>He will look into costs and time to plate the ship in copper.</li>
                                                <li>The Seaton Marines will arrive tomorrow -- while the ship is under repair, they will be kept busy guarding it.</li>
                                                <li>Gellan has shortlisted a couple of potential captains that he wants the party input on, when time allows.  Can decide a little later.</li>
                                                <li>Namaneed was hired on to the crew.</li>
                                                <li>When asked, he did not know anything further about the Abbey Isle but suggested the party look out for any potential business interests while there.</li>
                                                <li>He spoke in more detail to the party about Nine Lives.  As a member of the crew, she'll have duties while the ship is at sea, but in her capacity as Mystery Liaison, can be asked to join the party in adventures.  He also mentioned that she has previously worked for Anders, so might know something regarding his business, which could be lucrative.</li>
                                                <li>Gellan also spoke with Belizar regarding some other business. </li>

                                        <h3>Urgor chats with Ingo</h3>
                                            Following up on the history of Sheldomar Valley and the battles, Urgor caught up with Ingo to discuss what he knew about it.  Overcoming his initial apprehension, Ingo told Urgor:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Ingo was a former general that had actually fought in those battles.</li>
                                                <li>Though it was hard to remember what happened, both because it was so long ago and because he's tried to put it out of his mind, he remembered that battles were horrible - So much death and so much Ingo caused of it. Recalling the past he seemed miserable and said he had a lot to make up for. Ingo has done terrible deeds, he may never repay his debt to humanity, and will probably go to hell.</li>
                                                <li>Ingo Knew Arkon.  He was a sight to behold.  Stood over 10 ft’ and was built like a "Northern Steer".  No shackle could hold him down.  Seemed grow in battle.  Ingo was genuinely afraid to be in Arkon's presence.</li>
                                                <li>Arkon led the Shard which was a cult to Mephistopheles, archdevil in the Nine Hells.  Ingo’s soul was pledged to Arkon.</li>
                                                <li>Mephistopheles gave Ingo unnaturally long life.  </li>
                                                <li>The battle was actually three sided, though remembered in Keoland as a victory of Keolish forces over Dreadwood.  In fact, the Shard had led an attack into Dreadwood but it had been stopped.  By Nightshade.  He thinks it was Nightshade the fell Arkon.</li>
                                                <li>After the battle Ingo’s troops dispersed.  Paavo Horncarver was another Goliath general who was actually there at the end and hasn’t been seen since, presumably his troops dispersed too.</li>
                                                <li>Ingo knew Horncarver – he was extremely ambitious and had his own deals with Meph.  Horncarver was around Arkon since the beginning, his oldest general.  He was brutal and loved dominating his foes.  Hasn’t seen him in years, and that battle changed everything.</li>
                                                <li>He said that if the party was going to the Drowned Forest that were weak points to Shadowfell there -- where hope gives out and shadow crossings spit out some fell beast or another.  He also warned to guard your souls...</li>
                                                <li>Ingo declined to join the party.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                    <h3>Burle and The Drowned Forest part 1/2</h3>
                                        <h3>Arriving in Burle</h3>
                                            In Burle the party met with the Castellan, Kiara Shadowbreaker and relayed the raid on Saltmarsh.  She was sympathetic but said that there were no knights available to support as they were already overstretched with Dreadwood threats and the Wild Flame pact.  She said that there continued to be higher than normal incursions from the threats there and that some of the nobles that border the forest (to the North and East) had complained about attacks as well.  As the party was leaving, news came of the death of Sir Rudolff, the top Paladin of Kord at Burle, who was killed by fey forces in Dreadwood.  The had used illusory and necrotic magic to kill him.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Preparation to Leave</h3>
                                            Following the advice of Kiara, the party visited the Elves of Silverwood and met with Gendal'ii.  She didn't have much news of the Drowned Forest but said they had sent some rangers to look for the lost halfings about 1 week ago.  The rangers travelled into the forest for 3 days and returned empty handed.  She advised that the party forget about halfings, that they were a lost cause, and stay out of the forest.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party continued on the Heatherholm Hills, which is a confederated settlement of 5 halfling villages.  Near the outskirts at East Largests (a big town), they met with the current chancellor of the villages who was very thankful that the party was investigating the disappearances.  He said that there seemed to be no rhyme or reason behind why the four halfings up and walked out into the forest in the middle of the night.  Around a dozen other halfings have had visions of what sounded like Seja in their dreams, but these were inconsistent -- some said he was surrounded by fire, some by a bright light, there was a mace in one, a morningstar in another -- all agreed that the halfling was exceedingly handsome.  The chancellor offered 500gp, which the party did not accept on the spot.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            In the evening, Urgor responded to a mysterious letter delivered by a boy earlier in the day, asking to meet him at the Fallow Field, a cheap inn outside the keep.  Ingo and Jermaine were there and asked to join the party after all -- Ingo saying that he had unfinished business and that he could perhaps get them into forest.

									   <h3>Days and Nights in the Forest</h3>
                                            <b>Day 1-3</b>
                                            <br/>
                                            As the entered the forest, the land started a gentle rise which kept up for nearly three days.  The forest was old and trees thick -- many 10 - 15 ft in diameter or larger.  The lightly wooded areas became denser.  With the worry of the dangers in the forest, the party decided to travel slowly.  Despite a couple instances getting turned, they made slow and steady progress. They came across an abandoned farm that looks like it was previously occupied with halfings, growing berries.  Later, they found large eggs in a nest on the ground which they ignored.  Finally, they saw a tree house of elven make, and Nine explored this, finding a couple potions and a beautiful small golden bird inscribed with its species in elven.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            <b>Day 4</b>
                                        <br/>
                                            On the fourth day, the party reached a ridge and the land rapidly descended.  Vision was reduced.  On the ridge one could see about 1 mile out of thick forest.  Between the trees darkness reduced vision to around 100 ft.  Mushrooms and fungus were in abundance.  Seja noted that some were poisonous and the party identified some as Shriekers.  The air became thick with spores, making it more difficult to breath.  Some of the water seemed to have a green-blue luminescent hue to it and stood in unmoving ponds in between the trees.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            As one of the horses took a drink of the water, it came up snorting and bucked Frederick off.  The party was ambushed by twig blights and thorn slingers, which were unnoticeable until they started moving.    Fighting them off, the party found the dead horse 500 ft away and recovered its supplies as well as killed off the blights that were on it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Carrying on the party decided to follow a game trail, without any other idea on the correct heading.  The party came across some elk and noted what they seemed to be eating (fungus).  At this point, everyone started having strange, unusual feelings -- Nine realized that this was probably something do to being close to Shadowfell.  Belizar wanted reassurances, Seja talked about how his family was butchered, Urgor admitted that others were better than him at something, and Nine started studying her most mundane dagger in detail.  Urgor and the party noticed that Belizar's travelling cloak appeared to be grey instead of blue.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Coming a small clearing the party found signs of a battle fought long ago -- between elves and Orcs.  This reminded Ingo of the many similar such battles and many that he had killed.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            On the fourth night the party was attacked by strange humanoids that appeared lost, moaning "home... lost.... found..." and giving everyone big (deadly) embraces.  They were resistant to most damage.  Five limbs with spikes for hands, they emitted an intense fear and pain and shared this with anyone whom they embraced. Urgor was hugged and fell unconscious screaming for home, healed quickly by Seja before dying.  Nine recalled some of her studies on Shadowfell  that it may have permanent affects on those that stay there and feelings of hopeless sometimes manifest in creatures such as these.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            <b>Day 5</b>
                                        <br/>
                                            Travel on the fifth day followed the game trail.  This came to a stop after an hour or so and the party continued in the general direction they were previously travelling.  Climbing a tree, Nine noticed that the sun could not be seen, nor could any clouds, that the darkness was just everywhere.  There were no landmarks that could help with navigation.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Continuing on, their march was interrupted by arrows whistling through the darkness, one hitting Ingo, the others missing.  Hiding and trying to flank their unknown assailants, the party could not find anything, nor were any further shots fired.  Ingo noted the arrow that hit him did so with more force than usual.  They decided not to pursue.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party then came across two corpses of grey-elves, killed with arrow shots about 1 week ago.   These had piercings' and tattoos of ravens and shadows. A couple more were dragged off.  Tracks leading away were humanoid boots and large dog.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Continuing in the direction of the game trail, a few hours later, the party discussed turning back.  Seja convinced the party that Yondalla had assured him that they would the halfings if they pressed on.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            A corpse of a giant bear with elk anters and fiery eyes and black drool was then found -- around 2 weeks old.  It looked as though it was attacked by a larger force (>10) and had been killed with sword, arrow, and necrotic magic.  It was cleaved nearly in half.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            While considering setting camp, Seja was urged on to a small pond that was bright and clear.  Above it a small golden fleeced flying elephant was trading blows with a couple swarms of blights.  Seja and Urgor rushed forward to defend it and a battle ensued.  Wood, Vine, and Needle blights emerged from the nearby forest after several loud noises: thunder, trumpets, and a bone pipe melody.  The horses ran into a bunch of needle blights and only 1 survived.  Frederick nearly died, saved at the last moment by Seja's channeling of their shared divinity.  The elephant meanwhile had a brief chat with Nine in celestial, telling her that he was Indra the Hollyphant and he was seeking Seja for an important message.  When assailed by the blights, Indra transformed into a Mammoth and stomped a few.

                                            Following the battle, Indra the Hollyphant buzzed around Seja for, talking to him telepathically.  He made an off-hand comment that Nine Lives was a "funny looking creature".  Then Indra did a spiraling dive into the pool, disappeared, and left behind was a glimmering object in the water.  Seja dived in and retrieved a chain belt on which was a tome, a knife, and a talisman.  He announced that he was now in a pact with a celestial being called Magnificus who was associated with the god Tritherion.  The party questioned Seja on his allegiances and objectives.  Seja said that he would follow through with his promise to save the halflings and still followed Yondalla.  He didn't say too much about the pact itself, but did mention that it meant that he would support Magnificus in his quest to rid the region of the greatest of evils, to confront tyranny, stand up for liberty, and be a force of retribution.

                                            Finding a suitable location to camp away from the pool, the party cooked up some horse meat and put in for the night.  On the first watch they were woken up by the sound of something heavy scurrying about -- 3 night scorpions emerged.  These giant scorpions were dark as the night itself stung with a blinding, paralyzing, poison.  Both Urgor and Nine Lives were poisoned before Belizar sliced through one of their stingers.  Defeating the scorpions, Belizar and Seja harvested some of the remaining poison and the party resumed their rest.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            At the last watch, Seja noticed small strands of webbing floating through the air.  Acting quickly, the party packed up and fled the camp before anything sinister could occur.

                                            The party continued following the game trail until coming upon the corpse of a small cat that had been killed some time ago.  Like the other corpses that had been found, this one had arrows protruding from it, but there also seemed to be many small bites as if from rats or some other small creature.  The corpse was identified by Nine Lives as a Shadow Boxer, a fey creature at home in darkness.  A battle had played out here as could be determined by the claw marks on the trees and prints on the ground.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party decided to follow the large dog tracks rather than the faltering game trail.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Continuing their way, the party found a crossing to the realm of Shadowfell, which appeared to be a deep dark gash in the trunk of a large tree.  Noticing the tracks led away from the portal, the party also avoided it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Hunted, Again</h3>
                                            Without warning an arrow slammed into Jermaine.  Several others flew overhead.  Determined to learn more, Nine Lives dashed at amazing speed, covering 120ft in a single round, straight in the direction the arrows were flying.  It was there that she saw three figures sitting atop Worgs with their bows drawn.  The two humans flanked the orc who dispersed immediately after she caught sight of them.  Nine yelled out who are you? -- but they were gone without a reply, firing a couple arrows as they parted.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party regrouped and discussed what to do when...
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Lady Damyiara's Offer</h3>
                                            Apparently watching the whole encounter on a branch nearby, a beautiful woman in heavy armor with feathery black wings introduced herself as Lady Damyiara.  She commented that the party was unlikely to live much longer at their current progress.  Nine Lives questioned who she was and her intentions, to which Damyiara only offered that her master wished to see the Shard destroyed.  She offered help in the form of a contract which would give the part access to magical arrows and a mask which could help them track the "Trappers", as she called them, as well as unnatural strength.  To get the items, the party would need to destroy a shrine to Mephistopheles outside the Shard's Fortress within 5 days.  Seja and Nine Lives warned that dealing with such a creature was dangerous, but Belizar decided to sign the contract, which was delivered by an imp that appeared next to Lady Damyiara.  After signing, he immediately felt his stamina increase, but felt guilt over the deal.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Lady Damyiara offered to give the party an accurate a map of the fortress for setting the prisoners free that were in the fortress.  Belizar asked instead for her help finding the fortress.  In the end no deal was signed as Belizar could not accept the price of failure -- damning a soul to Hell.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Finally, Lady Damyiara offered Urgor a figurine of summoning of a Mezzoloth that could help them defeat Horncarver, suggesting that he would probably kill the party.  She would give the party its true name and it would be compelled to help them when summoned.  Nine Lives knew of Mezzoloths -- they were powerful fiends from the lower planes that often were mercenary soldiers for Devils and Demons.  Although Urgor was open to the idea, he could not agree to behead Horncarver (or Arkon).

                                    <h3>Lady of the Lake</h3>
								        <h3>Rotten Ethyl on the lake</h3>
                                        <b>6th Night</b> <br/>
                                            Coming up on a larger lake in the forest, the party spotted a small hut on the shoreline, tucked in under some standing deadwood.  The circular hut was lifted off the ground and was made of short planks of wood.  At the landing next to the front door a little old lady swept up the dirt.  The party was very suspicious of an old lady living successfully here, but decided to approach carefully.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            When sighted, the old lady introduced herself as Rotten Ethyl and invited the party in for tea and to stay the night.  The interior of the hut was eclectic and immediately attacks the senses.  Bones, piles of wood, indeterminate organic matter were scattered about or in small grungy bowls.  Furniture was sparse and constructed crudely of a bright white wood.  The party piled into the cramped space and skeptically accepted Ethyl's hosting.  An extended kitchen filled most of the room with a stove and chimney carefully fit between the woodwork.  Shelves were packed with all manner of vials, jars, and ceramics – perhaps hundreds, the contents of which were very difficult to identify.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Ethyl had many questions for the party and told them a bit about herself.  She had been living in the forest for a long time, before the Shard came, which she hated.  She had survived with the help of little friends (forest creatures, gremlins, small rat people, etc.) and seemed openly hostile to the Shard forces who try to catch her.  She told of Arkon's fate -- that he was killed violently by Granny Nightshade, a night hag that ruled over Dreadwood and was immensely powerful and had pacts with the entities from the lower planes.  By her telling, the Shard had assaulted Dreadwood but was stopped by Nightshade and it was only later that the "fair folks" went after the much weakened forces of Nightshade.  However, she got away before they could catch her and has now returned.  Since then the Shard has remained in the forest and harass her among other things.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After some small talk and snacks, Nine Lives declared that she was very uncomfortable and wanted to know more about just who Ethyl was.  Ethyl than revealed that she as actually a green forest hag, but maintained her illusory appearance to not scare the party.  Nine started taking notes.  She explained that many of her kind were wicked creatures and she had been in the past.  But, over the years, she also became kinder over time.  Nine asked what her intentions were.  Ethyl said that she was mainly interested in company but asked for a few minor, optional, items that they might provide.  Only Belizar acquiesced and provided a small blood sample and agreed to share her bed for the night.  Hoping to make Nine feel a little more comfortable Ethyl taught her a spell (Identify) and provided her with a set of bones (components) to cast it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Seja asked about the lost halfings.  Ethyl said she hadn't seen them and wouldn't hold out much hope for them to survive.  If the creatures of the forest didn't get them then the Shard may have captured them for their purposes, she assumes death or worse.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Belizar asked about the shrine and direction to the fortress.  Ethyl confirmed that there was a shrine and fortress, but did not know how to get to it.  She said that she purposely stays away, but pointed in the direction she thought it was.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            In evening, those who did not smoke the Dreamleaf kept watch.  Not paying much attention on the last shift, Jermain failed to notice one of gremlins knock over a jar containing a Dipsa, a small yellow gelatinous creature who's bite is very difficult to notice as it applies an anesthesia.  Only after it had devoured Urgor's left pinky toe, did he wake up, startled. Kicking Jermaine and plopping a container over the Dipsa, Ethyl said "Most sorry, but, at least it was only a toe."
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>An Imp nibbling on rations</h3>
                                            Feeling refreshed in the morning (except for the missing toe), the party headed out in relatively good spirits, diving back into the dark forest.  After a short while, Seja noticed that something invisible was stealing his rations.  2 rations were lost in all. Springing to action, Nine (blindly) tracked the sounds of the creature flying away and snatched it out of the air.  Once on ground, it turned out to be an imp that said it was ordered by Lady Damyiara to follow you to see if the party had changed its mind on the deals she offered.  Pleading to not be killed, the imp was tied up by Belizar and his magic rope clutch.  The imp eventually shut up.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Turn back.  You will not be warned again</h3>
                                            The party continued slowly and stealthily.  Next to the tracks, the party noticed a small candle and note, apparently left by the trappers.  The note said "Turn back.  You will not be warned again".  Not impressing anyone, Belizar snuffed out the candle and they continued on.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>A Cloak next to the Crypt of the Last of the Holt</h3>
                                            By mid afternoon the party spotted a bowl shaped clearing with nine pillars and a central stone.  Still dim light, the area was slightly less dark than other areas of the forest and the vegetation was relatively more verdant.  On the stone was writing in Elvish "Crypt of the Last of the Holt".  Inspecting the site, Belizar and Nine also found two black cloaks hanging on the pillars.  Grabbing the cloak, Belizar unwittingly disturbed a Cloaker, which looked identical to an actual cloak.  Two ambushed the party.  One enveloped Nine Lives with its wings while gnawing at her with its mouth.  Seja's spiritual weapon cut into it, accidentally damaging Nine as well.  Getting free Nine slashed at it as it tried to get away.  As the party ganged up on it, it let out a deep moan and two other illusory versions of itself appeared next to it.  Meanwhile Belizar slung the imp into the mouth of the other Cloaker which devoured it in one bite, nearly snapping Clutch in process and leaving only an imp leg.  Belizar, darting behind the pillars, snuck up and flashed his sword Illumina, which blinded the Cloaker and caused it to shriek.  Urgor dashed over and, with a heavy hand cleaved through the black shape.  Meanwhile the other Cloaker's illusory duplicates were found out and it was reatreating into the forest.  In vengenance, nine blasted it with an Ice Knife before it could get away.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Finding an entrance to the Crypt at the base of the central stone and stairs going down, the party discussed whether they would enter.

								        <h3>Crypt of the Last of the Holt</h3>
                                        <b>7th Night</b> <br/>
                                            At the entrance of the crypt, piles of bones and rotted armor littered the stairways and landings.  Entering the crypt proper, the party found a number sarcophagi, many with pledges written in Elven:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>I Will not rest until the corruption leaves Silver Holt</li>
                                            <li>Pledge my life and soul to purge this evil</li>
                                            <li>My sword, my faith, my honor, and my life for the Holt</li>
                                            <li>While others may flee, I enter the darkness to destroy the foes of the forest</li>
                                        </ul>
                                            After a brief encounter with Spectral Guardians, in which Seja was nearly killed in one turn, two Ghosts appeared -- one possessing Urgor. The ghosts were dressed as noble Wood Elves, one male, one female. He was momentarily out of control of his body and felt it searching his soul.  Apparently satisfied, the possessed Urgor spoke in Elvish to the Guardians "Sleep" and they ceased their hostilities.  The party carried on warily.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Nine Lives and Belizar searched a number of the other rooms, all of which were mostly empty and worn with age.  Several magical blue flames burned cool on braziers and had the symbol of Corellon Larethian, perhaps the most well known racial god of the Elves.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After exploring much of the crypt, the party came to a larger room in which the two ghosts were floating around.  A large silver symbol of Corellon Larethian with green gems was at the back of room. The tables had tanks inset with pools of bright blueish white liquid.  A handle poked out of one.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The ghosts then introduced themselves as Aven and Tanya Daemora and told the party the story of their curse and quest.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party learned:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The "Holt" is a part of Silverwood.  It is now called the "Drowned Forest" but at one time it was one with Silverstrand.</li>
                                            <li>The Silverwood Elves once lived here and tended the Holt. They kept other creatures at bay: orcs, goblins, gnolls and their ilk.</li>
                                            <li>At some point, a blight appeared and began infecting the whole forest.  They didn't know the source.</li>
                                            <li>The elves allowed in a Goliath (Arkon) and his small band who promised to end the rot.</li>
                                            <li>They seemed to be successful and it subsided briefly only to come back as strong as ever. </li>
                                            <li>The elves learned that the Shard had been created and was a cult to Mephistopheles.  They had restored an old ruined fortress in the Forest and were raising an army.</li>
                                            <li>The elves tried to fight them off, but most ended up retreating to Silverstrand --- the area closer to Burle.  Aven and Tanya led those that remained to defend the Holt.</li>
                                            <li>The elves of Silverstrand responded to the threat of the Shard by cutting off the water supply to the forest by diverting the river.  In response, the Shard used some foul magic to sink the forest, making it even bleaker.</li>
                                            <li>The defenders of the Holt were not particularly successful. Many died fighting the Shard.  Facing defeat, Aven and Tanya made a vow revenge and appealed to Corellon Larethian.</li>
                                            <li>Aven and Tanya attacked the fortress, but failed. They were then bound to the crypt until the leader of the Shard was destroyed.</li>
                                            <li>Over the years, there have been a number of champions who made similar vows, none successful.  They now guard the crypt as Spectral Guardians.</li>
                                            <li>ven and Tanya offered magical items to help any who would take the vow of vengeance on their behalf:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Daemora's Retribution - a magical battleaxe</li>
                                                    <li>Aven's Mithril Chainmail</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                            Urgor made this vow, stating: "  ", and for a brief moment as he hefted the handle out of the water, thought the axe was actually two axes!

                                        <h3>Ambushing the Hunters</h3>
                                            Leaving the Crypt in the morning, the party was pleased to see Bill alive and well, tied up near the crypt entrance and munching on some grass.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After rest the party set out again into the forest.  Seja led the way on Bill, slumping over and acting injured in hopes that the hunters might try to capture him.  Belizar walked hidden beside him while Nine Lives, invisible, and then the rest of the party followed behind.  If the hunter's were waiting and watching, the didn't seem willing to bite on Seja's ruse.  After a couple of hours, Urgor, then the others heard a snap of a branch followed by some arrows from the dark.  Seja jumped off the donkey and Belizar slapped his mask on and took pursuit.  When putting on the mask it seemed to grip his face, suctioning itself over his eyes and extending his eyebrow ridges.  A dark red glow was faintly visible.  Not finding anything the party came back together and considered what to do next.  As they were discussing, more arrows flew overhead.  Nine Lives cast haste on herself and, with an incredible speed, ran 150 ft towards the oncoming arrows to find the three hunters who were startled, to say the least.  She flanked the human rider in the middle, while the others peeled off in wide circle.  Slashing and her blade singing, she scored several hits on the hunter who retreated away from her but towards the party.  Belizar, catching sight of one of the orc riders buried an infernal arrow in their side before he ran further in the forest.  The human rider, now bleeding, was scorched by Seja's Eldtrich blast which was followed up by another infernal arrow Belizar.  Ignoring Belizar and Ingo's shouts to let their quarry run, Nine Lives pursued, swiping wildly with her sword in a momentary bloodlust.  Frustrated on scoring no hits she threw her sword down.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Belizar's view, through the mask, saw the blood spatters in bright orange, misted over Nine and in large splotches on the ground.  The party pursued.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Not more than 500 ft along the path a dead orc lay on the ground.  After a quick inspection, Nine hurriedly pocketed the long bone knife, strange flint, and a feathered necklace that had tiny writing on it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>A shrine in a pool of ooze</h3>
                                            With Belizar's red glowing eyes leading the way, the party followed the trail of blood until reaching a pool of viscous green ooze that had a 15ft tall stone, 4ft wide in the center.  Blood tracks skirted the edge of the pool and then carried on in a different direction than before.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Around the pool there was no vegetation with only a couple large trees along the sides of the pool.  The stone in the center looked like tree limbs, with lots of vertical bulges, and had dark shadows in the core where the bulges fractured.  Near the top of the stone, an 2ft wide golden icon with a red sun eclipsed by three mountains was inset in the stone.  Ingo recognized this to be the symbol of Mephistopheles.

                                        <h3>The Shrine of Mephistopheles</h3>
								        <b>8th Day</b><br/>
                                            A viscous green ooze filled a 60ft diameter pond.  Plant life was noticeably absent around the edges.  At the center stood a 15ft tall stone pillar, roughly 4ft in diameter and slightly reminiscent of a tree with vertical bulges traveling its length and at its core was a dark energy.  Inset in the pillar was a 2ft wide golden icon with a red sun eclipsed by three mountains.  Ingo recognized this to be the symbol of Mephistopheles.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party experimented with the ooze, trying to discover its nature.  Urgor tossed a stone, Belizar heaved a branch, and Seja cast a sacred flame into to -- it seemed unperturbed and the objects that lay on it slowly began to sink into the ooze.  Belizar and Urgor tried to dig a trench to empty out the ooze, but decided it would take too long to complete the task. Seja tried casting dispel magic on the ooze, but this didn't seem to have an effect.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            By now 5 hours had passed since Belizar donned his mask and, wondering about the effects, he removed it and immediately was blind.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party now turned its attention towards damaging the stone.  Seja Eldrich Blasted it several times, but didn't seem to effect it.  Urgor asked Yahui about how to destroy shrines -- Yahui advised using strong magic.  Seja blasted it with Sacred flame,  this time the radiant energy actually broke into the stone and chunks fell away.  Another blast and the party noticed bubbles showing up in the ooze.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Its maw snapping and letting out a howl, a huge three-headed dog emerged from the ooze.  Seeing Seja's blasts, it kicked off the ooze and bounded over to the party, letting loose cone of molten rock that blasted through half the party.  Seja continued to blast the stone as party spread out and tried to protect him.  With hesitation, Belizar put the mask back on -- his sight returned with a deep piercing pain as it gripped into the scars on his face. Moments later the dark energy in the stone rushed downwards into the ooze and more bubbles appeared in the pond.  Two hell hounds emerged, their bodies wreathed in flames and their jaws smoking.  Then two more.  Seeking to avoid the ooze, Nine Lives leaped to a patch of earth in the pond and blasted the stone with an ice knife, drawing the attention of the hounds.  Belizar and Urgor laid into the three headed monstrosity and cleaved through dog after dog.  Frederick tended Seja's wounds, while Seja himself called upon his life magic to heal the party.  Ingo and Jermaine kept the dogs at bay with thorn whips and heavy bolts flying through the air.  Finally, the stone's integrity was weakening.  More blasts.  Surrounded by two hounds, Nine Lives thunder stepped around the edges of the ooze - the cracks of thunder being followed by howls of pain and then quiet.  Urgor surged forward, leaping into the fray with his swords drawn -- and in the end, the last dog standing.  The stone fell, the golden icon crashing into the ooze and began to sink in.  The party all looked to Belizar as he explained that he intuitively knew the weight of his infernal contract had lifted.  He peeled the mask off, burning as it gripped onto his face -- blindness again.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Burned and battered, the party rested and waited to see if Belizar sight would ever return.  Finally, it did.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>A cave entrance</h3>
                                        <b>9th Day</b><br/>
                                            Back on the trail, the blood tracks started to falter.  Shortly afterwards, the corpse of the human hunter was found in a pool of blood and dragged for a hundred feet or so by his mount.  The hunter had a necklace, that like the other had tiny writing on it with the following statements: “I go as I please”, “The Shard is my clan”, “My worth is my strength”, “The weak risk all”, “Hear Mephistopheles, but do no more.”
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Reasoning the hunter was heading to shelter, the party followed the direction it had been travelling in.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Not long after, the forest began to open up, with a dim light making it through, making it easier to traverse.  Finally, they spot a small mound of granite revealing a cave entrance that immediately slopes downwards into the ground.  Around the entrance, the darkness recedes a bit – a dim light surrounds a 500ft radius around the cave entrance.  There are boulders and stalactites at the entrance, but these are easily passable. There is a scramble.  Tracks of humanoids and worgs were all easily noticeable around the entrance.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <h3>Dogs, no, not those dogs... bigger ones.</h3>
                                            Descending down the 40ft scramble the party entered a circular dark cave roughly 10ft wide and tall.  30ft in, a small tunnel broke off to the left only to come to an abrupt dead-end.  Piles of bones and dog feces left a stink in the air.  Another 50 feet in, The tunnel split.  As Belizar was ahead inspecting the paths there was a a deep growl on the left-hand side, then yips, followed  then by quiet.  Returning to the party they began to discuss tactics but were interrupted by a worg, deep in the tunnel talking in goblin--- "Killing the master... you must leave...".  It let out a defeaning howl, which was then joined by a chorus of howls behind it as several more worgs rushed out of the left tunnel.

								        <h3>Worg's Bane & The Roper</h3>
                                        <b>Day 10</b><br/>
                                            The harrowing howls of the worgs upon them, Urgor slashed with Daemoira's Retribution, its blue blade drawing blood from any beast which came within reach. A radiant light fell around Seja as he cast spirit guardians that lashed out the pack of worgs.  They fell left and right until the alpha worg finally fell.  Behind them, in the tunnel, the sounds of yelps -- worg pups, could be heard.  Unwilling to take any chances the party delve forward intent on cutting them down.  They stopped when Belizar heard one talk again in goblin, a strange stuttering, growling version of the language.  "We submit" they said... and the party halted their attack.

                                            With the worgs retreated, the party delved further into the cave, finding some signs of humanoid life -- stairs carved into the passageway.  Heading upwards the tunnel branched and after a brief scout, Belizar led the party forward through the darkness.  The tunnel's sidewalls became narrower and the ceiling separated from the ground.  After several turns, the tunnel opened up into a wider cavern with stalagmite and stalactite formations.  As they progressed, 6 tendrils slipped down from above and grasped out at the head of the marching order -- Seja and Belizar were grabbed and reeled in upwards.  Hacking and slashing with his off-hand Belizar freed himself.  Seja's spirit guardians thrashed at the tendrils and, as he got closer to the ceiling, at the maw and body of the weird Roper that had ambushed them.  Meanwhile, Jermaine and Frederick fired bolt after bolt, failing to connect with anything soft.  Ingo, readied himself to catch Seja should he fall.  Urgor hurled a boulder which smashed into pieces somewhere at the top of the cave.  Fighting for his life, Seja evaded the bites of the creature until finally, the spirits found matter to kill -- and that they did.

                                        <h3>The Hunter's Abode</h3>
                                            Not much further along, the cave's stone walls changed from natural to clearly hewn by human hands -- flat floors and angled walls.  In the back a small passageway led to a couple of adjoined rooms with several cots and a kitchen.  A half dozen rations and some arrows were found on the shelf along the wall.  At the central table there was a log book that seemed to capture weekly - bi-weekly updates from the hunter.  This indicated:   
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>The hunter was often gone weeks at a time, presumably in the forest </li>
                                                <li>Each entry noted at least one creature, some of which sounded familiar to the party.  Also, how long they were tracked and a resolution - i.e. killed, warned...</li>
                                                <li>Some entries noted "slayers", these creatures were not killed by the hunter and tended to be nastier.</li>
                                                <li>Some entries noted humanoids that were either taken in for sacrifice or recruited</li>

                                        <h3>The Sunker Shard - Fortress of the Shard</h3>
                                        <b>Day 11</b><br/>
                                        <b>An Illusionary Pit</b><br/>
                                            Leaving the hunter's abode Nine discovered a hidden illusory wall that led `through' the cave wall. After casting Dispel Magic, Seja revealed a false floor and a pit below.  Avoiding this, the party entered the fortress proper
                                        <b>Supply Room</b><br/>
                                            After following the dark tunnel for around 500 ft, the party heard voices in the distance coming from a room adjacent to the passageway.  A half dozen men were busy in a supply room full of equipment, weapons and armor, and hunting traps.  Nine cast invisibility and carefully snatched up some vials while the men weren't looking.  Belizar followed the main tunnel around and past a heavy set door with a pool of blood at its entrance.  He pressed on and found two guards in a room with trophies along the walls of strange creatures.  
                                        <b>Prisoners Found?</b><br/>
                                            Meanwhile, Nine crept past the guards and found a room with a small hole in the ground and light streaming out.  Without warning a rat snuck by and peered over the hole.  A tiny stick batted it away and with screech it ran off.  Nine investigated and found what appeared to be several prisoners, including one halfling, locked in the room below.  They could offer no advice on how to find the door other than to say that there was a jailer "Bhol" that had the keys.  Nine took one quick look further on into a large round room that was full of vegetation and a large relief carved into the walls.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Returning to the party, the remaining guards were ambushed and dispatched by the party without trouble.  A human, two orcs, and a goblin were killed -- each carrying the necklaces similar to the hunter.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Pilfering the room, Urgor left with a cape-sized thick green-scaled skin draped over his shoulders. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party resolved to hiding the bodies further up the cave and carrying up the main passageway.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The resident rats which the party had been trying to avoid watched on curiously and ran off when Urgor got close.
                                        <b>Kitchen Staff</b><br/>
                                            With the full party advancing together now, they listened more carefully at the door with the pool of blood in front.  Belizar cleared it for traps and he and Nine set watch for anything unwanted visitors.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Inside, large carcasses at various stages of preservation hung from hooks attached to the ceiling.  The room smelled strongly of rot, preservation spices, much like a butchers shop.  Simple clay jars lined the shelves along the walls.  A hacking sound came from a brutish orc that with an oversized butcher knife that was deftly preparing a haunch of meat.  After mumbling something about being the 'new guy' and waving his cape, Urgor hacked at a goblin who emerged from behind a carcass.  Ingo and Jermaine piled in, followed by Seja.  The Orc growled and launched himself forward, cleaving through Urgor and Jermaine wide slashes.  Several more lightly armed goblins harried Urgor with dagger strikes at his flanks.  Another goblin at the back of the room began chanting and spikes grew from the floor.  Ingo and Seja tripped over these.  Urgor put out as much damage as he took, elbowing one goblin to its death, and cleaving large gashes into the butcher orc.  The caster then threw a small black stone to the ground in the midst of the melee and seconds later the earth blasted upwards, centered on Jermaine.  His body slumped in a pile of rubble.  Seja's spirit guardians cut through the remaining goblins and Urgor gutted the orc than sprung forward and piled on his attacks on the caster.  At the last moment the goblin pleaded "The meat is yours..." Urgor quickly questioned him on what they were doing and the purpose of the prisoners, and the goblin stuttered.  Disgusted, Urgor ended him.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Patiently waiting for reinforcements to come down the hallway, Nine decided to creep forward and ready herself to ambush the guards they saw earlier in the trophy room.  Despite some audible shouts and clashing of weapons, the guards did not seem to notice.  Taking matters in her own hands, she cast Greater Invisibility and Magic Weapon on herself and began her bladesong. In utter silence Nine crept around the orc guard and scored slash after slash, downing him before he knew what happened.  Following along Belizar witnessed the guard keel over with blood spewing from his midsection, his companion dumbfounded on what had happened.  Seeking to intimidate the other guard, Belizar threatened to send `his' spirit weapon against him if he didn't surrender.  Clearly uneasy, the guard lowered his weapon, but would not submit.  Moments later, Nine circled around and sprung on him, still invisible, killing him with ease.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The party searched and then stashed the bodies.  They regrouped in the meat room to plan their next move, aware that at some point the trail of blood they've left will be found.

								        <h3>The Room with the Plants</h3>
                                        <b>Day 11</b><br/>
                                            The party took the southern path and explored the big room Nine first discovered:
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            This spherical room has a tall ceiling and is 50’ diameter.  A wide variety of colorful mushrooms, plants and shrubs fill the room.  There is a strong smell of dirt, forest, and organic materials.  There are three hallways exiting the hall, one to the North, one to the SW, and one to the East.  There is a closed door near the S hallway.  The vines hanging from the obscure the ceiling, but it looks to be a dome.  On the NW end a series of 1’ pillars line the wall and an oversized ornate chair sits facing the room, though it is covered in plant life.  The lower half of a massive relief carved into the walls is on the W walls, but is also obscured by vines and mosses.  Despite the vegetation, there are circular rows and some of the plants are in planters.  On the SE corner of the room, a dais is raised 3’ where a small alcove of wiry trees and bunched – their foliage reaching into the ceiling.  At the edge of the room are several barrels in which a liquid of some sort drips loudly.  Several rats scurry away when you enter.  At the center of the room is a 5ft circular basin, which has several inches of bright blue-green liquid shimmering in it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Exploring the party found:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Water is dripping into the barrels</li>
                                            <li>There is a bright white object at the bottom of the central basin.  The liquid in the basin seems to clear and drinkable. Belizar took a big drink and was greatly refreshed.</li>
                                            <li>The relief on the wall was partially inspected -- the first three depicted scenes of:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>A large humanoid standing triumphantly in the middle of a tribe in the mountains.  Scores of others from nearby villages were coming to his village</li>
                                                    <li>The same person holding two gleaming swords overhead, while entering a forest.</li>
                                                    <li>The same person slaying a dragon and entering a fortress partially buried underground.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                            In the middle of their exploration, more rats were seen and started scurrying away.  The vines and branches started moving, coming to life and grasping at the party.  A battle ensued several blights attempting to grapple and crush the party.  Ingo was knocked out and brought back from the brink of death only by Seja's prayer of healing.  Urgor, Jermaine and Seja fought offer the larger branches while Belizar and Nine slashed at the vines.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Several swarms of rats emerged from underneath the planters and vegetation and harrassed Belizar.  Then, bursting through the Southern door, several guards being led by a massive Gnoll, entered the fray.  Rats followed underfoot.  Seeing the strangers fighting with the blights, the Gnoll readied its flail and taunted the party "Thieves and scoundrels my pets... eat them, gnaw on their bones".  The rats surged forward with hunger in their eyes, chittering loudly in reply.

                                            Eying Nine Lives, Ma whipped her flail forward as she ducked under the singing blades.  The three spiked heads slammed down, sending the tabaxi into a maddened frenzy.  Retaliating, Nine stabbed. The slices and cuts opened wounds that send blood over both Ma and Nine.  Another swing of the flail and Nine's vision blurred and she sensed herself somehow in a stinking pack of wild dogs, somewhere else.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Fighting on all fronts, Urgor brought both his weapons to bear upon the massive branch blight that was pinning down Jermaine.  Each attack was accompanied with a thunk and a small cloud of bark and fragments as he cleaved through.  Spitting and sputtering, he did everything to turn the attention of the blight -- distracted, it swung its branches through midair.  With a final blow, Urgor's enemy fell and he dashed to Gnoll.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Belizar's scimitar Ilumina slashed through the vines of the blight that held him.  To be held in one place, unmoving, was the worst fate for the swashbuckler who was accustomed to battles involving dashing and slashing, feints and ripostes.  The swarms of rats coming out of the woodwork made it worse.  Dancing, stomping and diving he evaded one swarm, running into another. Swerving, Belizar swung his blade in a flurry as he passed by, leaving a smear of rat gore.  Another swarm, this one bigger.  As he leveled his blade, Ma mumbled some unholy magic under her breath, her cape flittering, and then pointed at a rat next to him.  A crunch and a wooshing sound later, the rat grew.  Its proportions changed and its wee beady black eyes had an intelligence that wasn't there a second ago. "You" Ma pointed at Belizar.  He saw it all though.  The mutant rat-thing slashed left and right, Belizar dodged and then Illumina struck and for good measure he rammed through his knife.  Now, for Ma....
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Jermaine, bloodied and bruised, picked himself up from under an immense branch. He tossed aside. Enemies everywhere. Out of the corner of one eye is a blur of motion -- good, that's Belizar on the move again.  Thunk!  A javelin hits in the side. Guards.  The other spots another one making a run for the door, but there's no time. Where's Ingo?  On the gnoll... man he's got a lot of blood on him too, been a while since the old captain was this beat up. Something was climbing up his back and was biting into the soft spots between his scale plates. They'd have a hard time getting through, anyway, another guard drew his sword and that will hurt if he doesn't get his shield out in time... damn rats.  That's a lot of blood, his blood.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Seja's soft prayer to Yondalla was unheard by all but his deity.  Yet it was answered with a rush of glimmering light that streamed out through the room.  Seeing his friends fall, Seja concentrated entirely on mending their wounded bodies.  Gashes closed.  Skin reformed anew.  Resolve was regained.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Crack went her flail, battering Nine and disrupting her song. "...And stay down" growled Ma with a grin.  The cat snuck in one more slice before she fell.  The halfing was irritating, but the Goliath hurt.  Without warning a heavy blow from his wicked blade.  He laughs as he crushes one of her dolls.  Behind her a sly half-elf comes to prick her with his sword.  They all come to die.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Seja's sweat poured down in exertion.  Yet he could not stop -- it meant death.  For his friends, that could not be allowed.  Nine! She must live -- Yondalla protect her!  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Fighting for every breath, Nine's senses returned. The packs of dogs were gone and she heard, felt, Seja's prayer all around her, warding off death.  The slavering gnoll licked her lips and then growled as she made eye contact with Nine.  Not dead yet -- and her blades were still in reach!  Ma would be her kill.  Dodging the flail ball, she slashed with her main hand, then shifting her balance to her off-hand which followed.  Two more scores.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Ma started snapping at anything that came close.  Urgor, Nine, Belizar, and Ingo circled, whittling Ma's lifeforce away with every opening. But none of them would claim the kill.  A burst of eldritch energy left Seja's hands and moments later manifested in Ma's guts. A thick shower of blood covered them.   With disgust it wasn't her kill, Nine eviscerated the guard left standing next to the heap which was Ma and then buried her dagger in the gnoll's skull.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Ma was dead.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Jermaine lay in a heap of rats, dying. A guard had escaped. Urgor tended his wounds -- he was unconscious but gravely hurt.  There was little time to prepare. The party sipped the delicious well liquid, feeling greatly refreshed.  Each drink from the well depleted its reservoir, it now was 6ft from the top.  Urgor reached down to get one final cupful for Jermaine, his eyes gazed a bright shiny object at the bottom of the basin.  As he watched, it made figure eights at the bottom.  Intrigued, Nine cast Detect Magic on the liquid and creature -- finding that it was magical and with it the liquid.  It radiated with evocation, tapping some unseen source of power to create energy. She was skeptical and withheld her swig despite Belizar attesting to its benefits.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            The moment was broken when muffled voices echoed into the room from the North door.  Men were moving. Belizar snapped into action and started barring the North door, finding only a vines draping down -- nothing to bar.  Nine readied a spell and the others prepared for another wave...
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            A well toned olive-skin human entered swiftly.  He stopped 10 feet from Belizar and surveying the butchery in front of him.  The warrior wore fine leather and held a gladius in one hand, a small shield in the other.  He commanded attention.  A helmet featuring a black plume hid most of his blond hair.  In seconds it was clear that his sharp features matched his motion- honed, efficient, flawless. Two guards on his sides, an orc and human, looked drab and ungainly with their battle axes.  Dark shapes of a half dozen guards, at least, on other side of the vine drapery stopped and waited for the leader's word.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            An agonizing second passed, everyone waiting for who would make the first move.  Nine reached into her component pouch, visualizing the magic which would manifest an ice-knife that would bolt across the room, exploding in a shower of shards.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Then the human lowered his weapon slightly and smiled at the party, "Well... this is different... who are you?"

                                    <h3>Bhol Eye Cleaver and His Army, Freed Prisoners, and Choices</h3>
                                            After an uncomfortable moment, Belizar sheathed his sword and explained that the party was looking for any halflings that were brought here.  Bhol laughed at this, surprised that the party would be going to so much trouble for halflings. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Bhol noted that while he believed he would probably kill most of the party that they would probably kill him too.  "However, there is an army here that would descend upon the strangers...", he remarked.  Instead of bloodshed, he agreed that the party would be allowed to have the halfling that was imprisoned and then be allowed to leave.  He then asked if the party was in agreement...
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Urgor responded by noting that he wanted to destroy the curse and kill the Ancient.  Bhol laughed and said that the curse was part of the forest.  Frustrated and attempting to surprise Bhol and cleave him down, Urgor rushed him.  Bhol was ready though, he struck Urgor first and slammed him to the ground.  Urgor regained his composure and scored a hit on Bhol.  Meanwhile, Nine jumped in the well.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Nine found that the bright shining object was in fact a very peculiar sea horse at the bottom at the well.  It had a miniature metal collar around its next that was attached to a long needle that impaled it.  Holding it in one hand, Nine carefully broke the chain and then dislodged the needle.  The creature wiggled in pain, but emerged alive, barely.  Nine Lives used a healing potion to heal it up and dropped it back into the well.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            As Nine was in the well, Urgor's sparring was halted with Bhol asking to speak instead of fight.  He made a proposition to the party that he would allow them to attempt to kill the Ancient (Horncarver) and even take steps to make sure they could traverse the lower levels without running into the army.  Bhol explained that he did not agree with the Ancient's running of the clan, and, wished again to see his homeland.  Bhol told the party:
								            <ul>
                                                <li>There were a number of slayer groups which were searching for the party in the forest.  Bhol would need to throw them off and clean things up around the fortress to give them time.</li>
                                                <li>He guessed he could give them about 4 hours, after which the fortress would be occupied and the party's presence could not be concealed.  Additionally, the party was not allowed to proceed further North in the fortress where they might be spotted.</li>
                                                <li>Bhol's warriors were loyal to him and would help --- other warriors in the 'clan' could not necessarily be trusted. </li>
                                                <li>If the party was too slow, Bhol would not protect them in any way.</li>
                                                <li>The Ancient was below, through the door to the South.</li>
                                                <li>The curse in the forest was part of the forest.  There is an entity below the Ancient, that amplifies this curse.  He has never seen it, only heard of it, and, doesn't know how to kill it.  Bhol did not care whether the party killed it.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Coming to agreement, the party proceeded quickly down the South passage to find immediately a prison.  There were 7 prisoners that the party spoke with.  They looked famished and had bite marks all over their legs --- harassed by the rats.  The party learned the following:
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Cable - middle aged human with tattoos of jackals over his body.  He captured Jonen, and was evading the Knights of Burle by entering the Drowned Forest, whereby they both got captured by the Shard.  He appeared to be a bandit of sorts and was boisterous.  Cable spoke of some treasure that was here... "Ruby's the size of cities".  He asked to join the party in order to split the treasure they found.</li>
                                                <li>Jonen - elderly human in a light blue robe who leaned on a cane.  Jonen said that he was a scholar from Niole Dra.  When he was brought here his books and records were stolen.  He asked to join the party so he could find said books/documents.</li>
                                                <li>Mordecai - middle aged human in noble's clothing.  He said that he was captured by the Shard and wanted to leave as soon as possible.  He said he sold glasswares and glass trinkets. </li>
                                                <li>Fin-had and Cl'riyx - Two grey-elves, Shadar-Kai, that said they were from the Shadowfell city of Dusk Needles.  They said that they were scouting the Shard for the Raven Queen and they do her bidding without question.  They were eager to return to Shadowfell where they could raise an army to assault the Shard.  They said that they would get reinforcements from Uncle Sahdow-chaser from the ports.  They identified the grey creature as the "Lost" and told Nine how to avoid such creatures in Shadowfell.</li>
                                                <li>Grey - a three armed creature from Shadowfell that appeared to be tortured.  The party left it chained to the wall.</li>
                                                <li>Mr Griffo Dudley - Halfling from Heatherholm Hills.  After getting over his initial fear of Seja, he was thankful for the party saving him.  He said that he had a terrible dream and then found himself in the forest, next to Ms. Daisy Burrows, another halfling that was taken.  He said that through he was not much of a fighter, could not imagine leaving without finding out what happened to Daisy.  He asked to join the party.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            After speaking to the prisoners, Jonen and Mr. Dudley were the only to join the party.  Fin-had and Cl'riyx wanted to leave immediately and Mordecai said he would tag along.  After asking the party if they were going for treasure, and getting very little positive response, Cable said it wasn't worth it and decided to join Fin-had and Cl'ryix.  The party gave them rough instructions on getting out.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            With Belizar in front checking for traps, the party continued.  They found a forge room, with very little in it except for a few unfinished weapons and raw materials.  Then they emerged into a long hallway with several adjoining rooms.  They explored a few of them.  One was very dirty and had a locked iron box (did not open).  The party moved along quickly.  Then they found a simple bedroom with a few cots and some personal effects.  The party stopped at the Southern hallway when they found the green ooze on the ground.  They checked a couple more rooms and found a room filled with clutter and a door at the back end.  Through the doors, stairs descended.

                                    <h3>Confronting Horncarver</h3>
								            The party searched through the remaining rooms, finding:    
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>One room full of glowing mushrooms.  Seja grabbed a small box with black truffles.</li>
                                                <li>A room with a dozen random weapons and armor</li>
                                                <li>The iron box was opened and contained mixed coins, a bag of holding, and a healing potion.  In the bag of holding there were three corpses.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            The party investigated the room with the stairs at the end.  The temperature was much colder.  In the rectangular room there was a door at the back.  In the middle were 5 statues, one looking very devil-like.  The party decided to leave it, and continue down the ooze filled corridor.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            But before they could, Bhol returned after he found that the non-halfling prisoners had been released.  He demanded Jonen, who cast a spell on Bhol and convinced him that Jonen was unnecessary to his plans.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After traversing the ooze, which burnt objects but not contact with skin, the party found a room which had a large serving platter on it and a list of food -- like an order.  In the adjacent room, a clutter of books and papers lined the shelves along the wall, which had some interesting notes about Arkon and Zenopus.  A puddle of ooze formed a circle that dipped slightly in the middle and had a translucent membrane over it. A blurry cave-like scene was viewable through the center of the ooze.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Continuing the party came to a large hexagonal room with a 10ft' ledge around the outside and a massive chandelier hanging above.  On the chandelier were two bodies, one a grey elf, one a halfling that were hardly moving and caught up in meat hooks.  On a large throne sat a Goliath in a smoldering suit of hides that featured 3 long teeth attached to the shoulder and skulls of elves and orcs on the suit itself.  He was flanked by 6 scantily clad women sitting on body pillows.  At the center of the room was another big pool of ooze with a membrane over it with two robed figures that seemed to be murmuring to themselves.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After a few taunts, the Goliath identified himself as Horncarver and asked how the party expected to live.  Battle broke out shortly thereafter with Ingo and Urgor leading the charge.  Horncarver's crescent shaped amulet glowed after Seja's opening gambit and disappeared after Seja smashed him with his eldritch blast and arriving unharmed next to Ingo.  He proceeded to deal heavy blows from his oversized axe to his hold comrade, nearly killing Ingo.  Nine attacked the harem, killing two immediately and send the rest into retreat.  Horncarver then threw out for figurines that landed on the ooze and drew from its power.  They transformed into merregons, who engaged the party with their halberds.  Belizar responded and backstabbed them until disengaging, hoping to grab the amulet from Horncarver's neck -- to no avail.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Urgor rushed the robed figures, grappling and then shoving one of them down the inverted ooze bubble.  Its robes flared up and his skin bubbled as he screamed to his death.  Urgor could vaguely see the charred remains deposited on the other side. The other cultist whipped out his bone blade and a sputtering fire crept up along its blade.  He pointed it towards Urgor and a ray of black energy beamed forth, sapping Urgor's strength.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Nine continued to slay the women with ease.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Frederick kept a steady stream of bolts firing across the room.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            With a devious grin, Horncarver evoked Mephistopheles name, and his form began to shift and grow.  Horns grew from his head, bat like leather wings sprouted, his skin darkened to the color of dried blood, and his muscles bulged under his armor.  With Ingo in his sights, he swung his axe and connected with Ingo's shoulder and face.  Blood splattered the wall as Ingo's chin was cleaved off.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Seja called for Yondalla and channeled healing throughout the room.  His word touched all his allies, helping them.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            From the East entrance, a new enemy strode in -- an orc magic user that instantly began hurling sorcerous bolts at the party.  With the majority of the party closing in on Horncarver, the mage conjured a cloud of poison that began sucking the life from everyone.  With feline rapidity, Nine darted across the room, skpping over the throne, and came down with both blades on the mage. The orc faltered and the spell failed.  As she retreated, Nine slew her down.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            As the battled carried on beside him Darcaym walked up to the center of the ooze, and unsheathed a dagger.  Reciting some incantation, he jammed it into the ooze.  Immediately the whooshing sound intensified and wind picked up around the battle.  Hundreds of screams were heard coming from the ooze itself.  Translucent white shapes surged through the ooze towards and up into the dagger.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Horncarver jumped into the air, landing next to Urgor and swung his battle axe.  Urgor, fighting for his life blocked half of the blows.  The Merregons fighting in unison began to falter under Belizar, Jermaine, and Seja's Spirit Guardians.  Another slash by Horncarver and Urgor goes down again.  Leaving Urgor to the merregons, Horncarver took to flight again, now landing next to Seja.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Quickling healing Urgor, Seja brought up his shield to block Horncarver's attack.  Crash, Crash, the shield held under the devil Goliath's blows.  Seeing her moment, Nine attacked without abandon, launching herself at Horncarver's form.  As she stabbed, he reverted to his normal form, dead and covered in gore.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            With the battle concluded, the party began exploring again - Belizar picking up the amulet, axe, and stripping Horncarver of his strange armor.  Urgor looked in vain for the tribal artefact -- if it was in the fortress it wasn't in this room.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Nine and Seja tended the wounded and brought down the elf and halfling.  Despite their efforts, the elf died as his wounds were too great.  The halfling was nurtured back to life.  She was clearly traumatized. Mr. Dudley immediately came and consoled her and promised that Mr Seja would protect her with Yondalla's word.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            After a moment of quiet, Darcaym announced that he would be leaving immediately.  He said that he was sorry he didn't tell the party of his disguise sooner, but that he had been on a mission for his patron.  He said that his path would surely take him elsewhere and that it both was urgent and an unnecessary danger to them.  Finally, he said that was not planning on returning to Saltmarsh, but would look them up if he did.  With a fond farewell he left.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                            Battered, the party thought of the timer Bhol had given them -- 3 1/2 hours remained...

                                                <li>Moving at fast pace -- everyone getting tired.</li>
                                                <li>Foulfoot suggests leaving the halflings to Belizar -- who, says that he won't leave them.</li>
                                                <li>3 nights through the forest.  Tense, but no encounters.  Everyone is REALLY tired now.</li>
                                                <li>Urgor reads about the Holt... really... well.  Recites what he learns to Yuhui.  Yuhui is super pleased with the esoteric crap.</li>

                                                <li>Bhol recalls the events at the fortress -- he tried to convince some of the other lieutenants to just go back to tending the forest, but they disagreed.  He was forced to leave after that and actively hunted.  An army still remains and a power struggle is likely.</li>
                                                <li>He doesn't know exactly how the curse can be lifted.  Stopping the Sacrifice of souls to Mephistopheles and killing the bone devil will slow it for a time.  But, it is likely someone else will become chief -- probably "Claw".</li>
                                                <li>There are other forces in the fortress --- an army that is powered somehow by the souls that have been sacraficed over the years -- probably 1000's.  The commander of the Fortress would be able to harness them.</li>
                                                <li>Party offers to be the envoys to Burle for Bhol and his band of men</li>
                                                <li>Bhol is skeptical - doesn't know how humans will react to his group.  Says he'll consider it and track down the party if he decides to do that.  Wants to know what is happening in Saltmarsh and Burle.  The party tells him that they'll stay in Burle for time, but then will be in Saltmarsh.  Bhol mentions something about becoming a mercenary group if there is war in the land.</li>
                                                <li>Urgor drinks with Ingo</li>

                                                <li>Pretty soon the chancellor arrives and proclaims that everyone is a hero.</li>
                                                <li>Stay at a nice inn -- The Pipe and Organs.  Big party to celebrate</li>
                                                <li>Chancellor brings 500gp in thanks.  Argument by the party on what to do with it.  Slightly awkward, chancellor leaves.  Nine ends up swiping the coins, Seja and Belizar want to leave it with the Chancellor.</li>
                                                <li>Belizar orders Nine to give it up.  She refuses.  Everyone goes their own way for the evening.</li>
                                                <li>Seja is met by Gwiston Gamwich -- an old friend from the Hermitage.  She says that the Arch-priest of Yondalla wants to see him in the morning.</li>
                                                <li>Urgor is piss drunk -- collapses in a corner and doesn't respond to anything or anyone.</li>
                                                <li>Seja seduces Gwiston, promising her everything.</li>
                                                <li>In the morning he says that it was just a one-night kinda thing, but that he might be back from time to time.  Gwiston's heart is broken.</li>
                                                <li>Seja visits the Arch-priest who says he had a vision that Seja was a hero.  A sacred artefact was placed by YONDALLA HERSELF at the church.  The priest says that no one is to touch it except Seja.  Looks very magical indeed.  Priest gives a strong warning that it could be a danger for anyone other than a devotee of Yondalla touch it.</li>
                                                <li>Shipments of halfling wine to Saltmarsh are backed up</li>
