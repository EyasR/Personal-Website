											<h3>Drowned Forest</h3>
											<p>Today, the Drowned Forest is perhaps the most dangerous location in the region. The trees remain standing, but they long ago lost their foliage and are little more than dead, rotting timbers projecting out of the mud. Mushrooms and other fungi sprout everywhere.</p>

											<h3>Dreadwood</h3>
											<p>Long a home of horrid monsters and vicious raiders, the Dreadwood hides within its borders a multitude of terrors. Keoland maintains ranger patrols that sweep through the outer reaches of the forest periodically, while several wood elf clans dwell at its edge. The two forces are generally successful at keeping the monsters of the Dreadwood in check, but at times a threat that avoids them or overcomes them emerges to wreak havoc across the land.</p>

											<h3>Yeomanry</h3>
											<p>Nestled in the foothills of the Crystal Mist Mountains to the South West of Keoland, the Yeomanry, tired of losses of its people in the Keolish wars, declared its independence from Keoland around 100 years ago following Keoland's Wealsun proclamation, effectively manifest destiny over the Sheldomar Valley.  This move was influential and led to other former provinces asserting their displeasure with Keoland.  Outside the capital of Loftwick, most lands are rural.  There is a relatively large dwarven presence in the little hills.</p>

                                        <li>Before taking the smuggler's ship, the workers at the fishmonger's district were struck blind (24 hours) over a period of a week.  A strong version of the poison "Malice" was determined by Seja.  No one was arrested for this, though the locals blamed the dwarves for uncovering something in their mines.  A street fight was narrowly avoided by Urgor's intervention</li>
                                        <li>Mud Mephits were stealing fish from Saltmarsh in the night.  Seja investigated and found them to be spawning from a portal at Warthalkeel ruins.</li>
                                        <li>Xendros is searching for a "Apparatus of Kwalish" and will pay for information or the item itself.</li>
                                        <li>Darcaym vanished under mysterious circumstances -- followed shortly thereafter by the murder of the prison Bloody Bjorn.  He's now suspected in Saltmarsh and wanted for murder.  He was last seen headed North to Burle and/or Niole Dra and mentioned Kiara Shadowbreaker.</li>
                                        <li>The council has agreed with the party that the ship could be theirs if they would be somewhat of a military naval presence for the city.  Gellan has a side deal with the party to run a trading business.</li>

                                <h3>Arkon's Infernal Contract</h3>
                                    This contract binds the envoys of Mephistopheles (“The Envoy”), and recipient (“The Ward”) into an infernal contract for an unending period of time, or this contract is voided by an agreement on the part of both parties. Upon agreeing to and signing this contract, The Ward is bound to their agreed obligations and parameters within the first pact, as is The Envoy.  The Ward agrees to the following terms and conditions as laid down in this contract, understanding unequivocally that this contract is binding and its conditions will last in perpetuity in all planes of reality. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the initial pact, the first pact is considered complete and concluded.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Specifics of the contract are hereby enumerated in full and self-sufficient for arbitration according to the original pact and contract. Insofar as further contractual arrangements are made, addendums are attached to this general contract and subject to its general terms unless expressly specified and in the addendum stipulations.  Such addendums must be signed or initialed and, after doing so, the contract becomes enforceable immediately and into perpetuity.  A provision for escalation, the Second Pact, can be triggered by The Ward anytime after signing of this contract and can be made by verbal acceptance to The Envoy.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Any violation of this contract on the part of The Envoy immediately holds this contract null and void, requiring a penalty payment of 15,000 gold pieces to The Ward to be paid immediately. Any violation of this contract on the part of The Ward immediately locks the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of The Ward, invoking the laws of the pact primeval, under the control and dominance of The Envoy for all of eternity, sending the soul of The Ward immediately upon death to The Envoy to do with as they see fit.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    In the unlikely event that The Ward is killed while on any layer of the Nine Hells ownership of this contract transfers immediately to Mephistopheles himself, thusly, death of The Ward, either permanent or non-permanent, does not void this contract. 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <u>EXIT CLAUSE</u>
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    In the event that either party wishes to exit this contract they may agree on a price at the time of request to break the contract with no penalties. Doing so will be arbitrated by Mephistopheles or his chosen representative and will take place on Cania by way of planeshift if both parties are not currently on Cania. The cost of the arbitration proceeding and any proceeding in court to confirm or to vacate any arbitration award, as applicable (including, without limitation, reasonable Arbitrators’ fees and costs), shall be borne by the party wishing to terminate the contract, as determined by the arbitrator, and shall be awarded as part of the arbitrator’s award. It is specifically understood and agreed that any party may enforce any award rendered pursuant to the arbitration provisions of this Section by bringing suit in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have authority to grant injunctive or other forms of equitable relief to any party. This Section shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The Envoy, KK’LARIS agrees to provide directions to the Ruins of the Cold Depths and the last known location of Soul Splitter.  Additionally, KK’LARIS agrees to immediately conjure forth a cadre of devils in service to The Ward, whom shall remain under the command of and dedicated to the protection of The Ward for the duration of 1 month. The cadre shall include four orthon and a single remmanon. Should any devils bound within this agreed upon cadre be slain outside of Baator, they are absolved of future service to The Ward.

The Ward also understands that the soul will be taken via supernatural force and agrees not to fight, interrupt or in any way hinder the souls transfer to The Envoy, including but not limited to (killing The Envoy, hiring others to kill The Envoy, hiding, leaving their current plane, destroying the contract, etc...).

                                    The body borne into the pit of devouring rises again eternally, its mortal bounds removed, its true purpose found.

                                    Your king, country, kin, and oneself, will find its purpose in undeath.  A sacrifice unto the world, sacred and free.

                                    Lay down your arms, brandish your chest, breath your last, and submit to the undeath...

                                    Arkon’s raids on the tower have continued in vain for the past month.  His incursion into Keoland has brought the attention of many, the crown and allied forces, but also the hag Nightshade.  The price of acquiring Lendor’s Cog and the Crescent Key was her summoning to the mortal realm. Her fate be realized shortly after Arkon is put down. <b>Z</b>

                                    Arkon’s siege has come without warning.  The Shard’s army have engaged the undead legions of Leej.  The Gnashers were summoned and streamed forth from the planar crossing tower pits, but have failed in their flanking of Shard’s infernal calvary.  Our allies from the South and East cannot respond in time. The Shard have attempted to penetrate the arcane defenses – to no avail of course.  No physical means, short of an earthquake could damage the tower.  The dead will rise night after night.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    If a siege it is, I simply await its end.  <b>Z</b>

                                    <br/>
                                    I cannot determine the time I was gone, but my recent studies into temporal magic has left me in some kind of temporal anomaly.  It felt like ALL of years, months, days, and seconds happened all at once.  After all this time, I still cannot control the Cog and Key.  Every step forward is accompanied by a step backwards.  But control must be possible.  A constrained temporal dimension has been tested within the tower stairwell.  I toy with simply allowing entry to the tower if only to marvel at the skill of its creation. <b>Z</b>
                                    <br/><br/>

                                    The Astral plane.  Nystul heavily used its pathways for time modulation since, at its foundation, time means nothing (and everything).
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Aside – The Cog and Key let me tune the purpose of the portals to astral pathways. Further modulation is needed as there are inconsistencies not accounted for. <b>Z</b>
                                    <br/><br/>

                                    If the portals can be used for empowering teleportation then it may also be true that they can empower inter-planer, inter-temporal sorcery.  My studies have not gone unnoticed, I’ve detected and neutralized scrying that I can only suspect the Silent Ones. By the Reaper, the Insights! The fundamental ordering of the planes and the rules which bind them could be changed.  Why then does vengeance matter any longer. Pride? Justice? Perhaps both.  The Old Empire   could be saved entirely.  Perhaps there are other mortal realms where things could be different...   <b>Z</b>
                                    <br/><br/>

                                    Another temporal loop and the portals have been stitched together with astral pathways with relatively higher consistency.  A small bargain was had with a celestial to learn the secrets of their binding.  I can see that my physical form is aging within a loop.  I am exhausted but cannot stop.  In the loop I created a cross-dimension which can be accessed through the portal.  An archmage of the Old Empire was listening and offers secrets to immortality.  I must rest now, but the defenses must be seen to.

                                    My aide sends word that Arkon has breached the entrance and died temporarily in combat with the Nightwalker, but his soul was not consumed and he has now returned. He is favored by his master. I must prepare. <b>Z</b>
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Arkon has evaded the Nighwalker and ascends the tower. <b>Z</b>
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    I am gravely injured. And there is little time.  He entered my sanctum and summoned otherworldly servants of Mephistopheles.  They have been banished to a time loop but could return at any moment.  I must retreat…  <b>Z</b>
